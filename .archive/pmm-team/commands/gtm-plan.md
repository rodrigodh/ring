description: Full go-to-market planning workflow from positioning through launch

I'm running the **GTM Planning** workflow to create a comprehensive go-to-market plan.

**This workflow produces:**
- Market analysis summary
- Competitive intelligence
- Positioning strategy
- Messaging framework
- Pricing strategy (if needed)
- GTM plan with channels and tactics
- Launch coordination plan

## Prerequisites Check

**Before starting, verify:**
- [ ] Product/feature is defined
- [ ] Launch date is known (or estimated)
- [ ] Budget range is known (or can be determined)

**If prerequisites not met, gather them first.**

## Document Organization

All artifacts will be saved to: `docs/pmm/<product-name>/`

**First, let me gather information:**

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather:

**Question 1:** "What product or feature are you planning GTM for?"
- Header: "Product/Feature Name"
- Use kebab-case for directory (e.g., "new-analytics-feature", "enterprise-plan")

**Question 2:** "What is the target launch date?"
- Header: "Launch Date"
- Specific date or timeframe (e.g., "Q1 2025", "March 15, 2025")

**Question 3:** "What is the launch tier?"
- Header: "Launch Tier"
- Tier 1: Major launch, maximum resources
- Tier 2: Significant launch, moderate resources
- Tier 3: Minor launch, minimal resources

**Question 4:** "What is the approximate marketing budget?"
- Header: "Budget"
- Range is acceptable (e.g., "$10K-$50K", "$100K+")
- Or "TBD - need to determine"

**Question 5:** "What existing GTM assets do you have?"
- Header: "Existing Assets"
- Market analysis, positioning, messaging, etc.
- "None" is acceptable

After gathering inputs, create the directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/pmm/<product-name>
```

## Remember

- **This is a gated workflow** - get approval at each gate
- **Positioning before messaging** - don't skip the order
- **Budget clarity is required** - tactics without budget are wishes
- **Timeline is fixed** - scope can flex, date cannot
- All agents use **model: opus** - do not use sonnet
