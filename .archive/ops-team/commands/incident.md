# Production Incident Command

This command initiates structured incident response following SRE best practices.

## Usage

```
/incident SEV2 API latency spike affecting 30% of users
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Incident Declaration

Parse the severity and description from the command arguments.

**If severity not provided:**
- Ask user to classify: SEV1 (Critical), SEV2 (Major), SEV3 (Minor), SEV4 (Low)
- Reference severity criteria from `ops-incident-response` skill

**If description not provided:**
- Ask for brief incident description
- What is the symptom?
- What is affected?

### Step 2: Dispatch Incident Responder

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "ring:incident-responder"
  model: "opus"
  prompt: |
    PRODUCTION INCIDENT DECLARED

    **Severity:** [SEV level]
    **Description:** [incident description]
    **Declared at:** [timestamp UTC]

    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
    1. Assess current impact
    2. Identify initial hypothesis
    3. Recommend immediate mitigation
    4. Document timeline

    Please provide:
    - Impact assessment
    - Initial triage findings
    - Recommended immediate actions
    - Communication template for stakeholders
```

### Step 3: Create Incident Structure

Based on incident-responder assessment, create:

1. **Incident Timeline** - Track all events
2. **Impact Assessment** - Document affected users/services
3. **Communication Updates** - Status for stakeholders
4. **Action Tracker** - Track mitigation steps

### Step 4: Ongoing Support

Throughout the incident:

- Track progress and timeline updates
- Coordinate between specialists if needed
- Document all actions taken
- Prepare for post-incident review
