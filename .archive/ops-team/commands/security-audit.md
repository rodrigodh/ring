# Security Audit Command

This command initiates structured security audit following the ops-security-audit workflow.

## Usage

```
/security-audit full soc2,pci
/security-audit iam soc2
/security-audit network
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Audit Scope

Parse scope and compliance frameworks from arguments.

**Scope options:**
- `full` - Comprehensive infrastructure audit
- `network` - Network security focus (VPC, SG, NACLs)
- `iam` - Identity and access management focus
- `data` - Data protection focus (encryption, access)
- `logging` - Logging and monitoring focus

**Framework options:**
- `soc2` - SOC2 Type II controls
- `pci` - PCI-DSS 4.0 requirements
- `gdpr` - GDPR infrastructure requirements
- `hipaa` - HIPAA technical safeguards
- `none` - Best practices only (no compliance mapping)

**If not provided, ask:**
- What is the audit scope?
- Which compliance frameworks apply?

### Step 2: Dispatch Security Operations Specialist

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "ring:security-operations"
  model: "opus"
  prompt: |
    SECURITY AUDIT REQUEST

    **Scope:** [scope]
    **Compliance Frameworks:** [frameworks]
    **Date:** [current date]

    Please perform:
    1. Automated security scanning (Security Hub, Config, GuardDuty)
    2. Manual review of [scope-specific areas]
    3. Compliance mapping to specified frameworks
    4. Vulnerability prioritization
    5. Remediation recommendations

    Scope-specific focus:
    - Full: All security domains
    - Network: VPC, security groups, NACLs, flow logs
    - IAM: Users, roles, policies, MFA, access keys
    - Data: Encryption, access controls, data classification
    - Logging: CloudTrail, audit logs, SIEM integration

    Output required:
    - Security summary
    - Findings by severity
    - Compliance status (if frameworks specified)
    - Prioritized remediation plan
    - Risk assessment
```

### Step 3: Generate Audit Report

Format findings into comprehensive security audit report.

## Output Format
