# Interviewing User for Requirements

## Overview

Proactively surface and resolve ambiguities by systematically interviewing the user BEFORE implementation begins. This prevents wasted effort from incorrect assumptions.

**Core principle:** It's better to ask 5 questions upfront than to rewrite code 3 times.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the ring:interviewing-user skill to gather requirements before we begin."

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Tool | Output |
|-------|---------------|------|--------|
| **1. Context Analysis** | Analyze task, identify ambiguities | Internal | Ambiguity inventory |
| **2. Question Clustering** | Group questions by category | Internal | Prioritized question list |
| **3. Structured Interview** | Ask questions using AskUserQuestion | AskUserQuestion | User responses |
| **4. Understanding Summary** | Synthesize and confirm | Text output | Validated Understanding |
| **5. Proceed or Iterate** | User confirms or clarifies | User input | Green light to proceed |

## The Process

Copy this checklist to track progress:

```
Interview Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Context Analysis (ambiguities identified)
- [ ] Phase 2: Question Clustering (questions prioritized)
- [ ] Phase 3: Structured Interview (questions asked and answered)
- [ ] Phase 4: Understanding Summary (presented to user)
- [ ] Phase 5: Proceed or Iterate (user confirmed)
```

### Phase 1: Context Analysis

**BEFORE asking any questions**, analyze:

1. **What the user explicitly stated** - Extract concrete requirements
2. **What the codebase implies** - Patterns, conventions, existing solutions
3. **What remains ambiguous** - Gaps between stated and implied
4. **What decisions I must make** - Architecture, behavior, constraints

**Create an Ambiguity Inventory:**

```
Ambiguity Inventory:
- Architecture: [list unclear architectural decisions]
- Behavior: [list unclear behavioral requirements]
- Constraints: [list unclear constraints or limitations]
- Preferences: [list unclear user preferences]
- Integration: [list unclear integration points]
```

### Phase 2: Question Clustering

Group questions by category and prioritize:

| Priority | Category | Criteria |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **P0** | Blocking | Cannot proceed without answer |
| **P1** | Architecture | Affects overall structure |
| **P2** | Behavior | Affects user-facing functionality |
| **P3** | Preferences | Affects style, not correctness |

**Question Budget:**
- **Maximum 4 questions per AskUserQuestion call** (tool limitation)
- **Maximum 3 rounds of questions** (respect user's time)
- **Prefer fewer, higher-quality questions**

### Phase 3: Structured Interview

Use `AskUserQuestion` tool with well-structured options:

**Question Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Shows what I already know (evidence of exploration)
- [ ] Explains why I'm uncertain (the genuine conflict)
- [ ] Provides 2-4 concrete options with descriptions
- [ ] Options are mutually exclusive or clearly labeled as multi-select

**Example - Good Question:**
```
header: "Auth Method"
question: "The codebase has both session-based auth (UserService) and JWT (APIService). Which should this new endpoint use?"
options:
  - label: "Session-based (Recommended)"
    description: "Matches existing user-facing endpoints, simpler cookie handling"
  - label: "JWT tokens"
    description: "Matches API patterns, better for external integrations"
  - label: "Support both"
    description: "Maximum flexibility, more implementation complexity"
```

**Example - Bad Question:**
```
question: "What authentication should I use?"
options:
  - label: "Option 1"
  - label: "Option 2"
```

### Phase 4: Understanding Summary

After gathering responses, synthesize into a **Validated Understanding**:

```markdown
## Validated Understanding

### What We're Building
[1-2 sentence summary of the goal]

### Key Decisions Made
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| [Topic] | [Selected option] | [Why this was chosen] |

### Constraints Confirmed
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

### Out of Scope (Explicit)
- [Thing we're NOT doing]

### Assumptions (If Any)
- [Assumption]: [What would invalidate this]
```

**Present this to the user for confirmation.**

### Phase 5: Proceed or Iterate

**Confirmation Gate:**

Understanding is NOT confirmed until user explicitly says:
- "Confirmed" / "Correct" / "That's right"
- "Proceed" / "Let's do it" / "Go ahead"
- "Yes" (in response to "Is this correct?")

**These do NOT mean confirmation:**
- Silence
- "Interesting" / "I see"
- Questions about the summary
- "What about X?" (that's requesting changes)

**If not confirmed:** Return to Phase 3 with targeted follow-up questions.

## Question Categories

### Architecture Questions
- "Which pattern should this follow: [A] or [B]?"
- "Where should this logic live: [Service A], [Service B], or new service?"
- "Should this be synchronous or asynchronous?"

### Behavior Questions
- "When [edge case], should the system [A] or [B]?"
- "What should happen if [failure scenario]?"
- "Should users be able to [optional capability]?"

### Constraint Questions
- "Is there a performance requirement for this?"
- "Does this need to support [specific scenario]?"
- "Are there backward compatibility requirements?"

### Preference Questions
- "Do you prefer [verbose but explicit] or [concise but implicit]?"
- "Should I prioritize [speed] or [maintainability]?"
- "Any naming conventions I should follow?"

## When to Auto-Trigger This Skill

Claude SHOULD invoke this skill automatically when:

1. **Ambiguity count > 3** - More than 3 unclear decisions
2. **Architecture choice unclear** - Multiple valid patterns, no codebase precedent
3. **User request is high-level** - "Build me X" without specifics
4. **Previous implementation was rejected** - Indicates misunderstanding
5. **Task spans multiple domains** - Frontend + backend + infrastructure

Claude should NOT auto-trigger when:
- Task is a simple bug fix with clear reproduction
- User provided detailed specifications
- Following an existing plan
- Single question would suffice (use doubt-triggered-questions instead)

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Asking without exploring first | Wastes user's time | Explore codebase THEN ask |
| Open-ended questions only | Hard to answer, vague responses | Provide concrete options |
| Too many questions at once | Overwhelming | Max 4 per round, max 3 rounds |
| Asking about things user already said | Shows you weren't listening | Re-read conversation first |
| Asking preferences when conventions exist | CLAUDE.md/codebase already answers | Follow existing patterns |
| Skipping summary phase | User can't correct misunderstandings | Always present Validated Understanding |

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| `ring:doubt-triggered-questions` | Use for single questions during work; use ring:interviewing-user for systematic upfront gathering |
| `ring:brainstorming` | Interview first to gather requirements, THEN brainstorm solutions |
| `ring:writing-plans` | Interview first to clarify scope, THEN create plan |

## Required Patterns

This skill uses these universal patterns:
- **State Tracking:** See `skills/shared-patterns/state-tracking.md`
- **Failure Recovery:** See `skills/shared-patterns/failure-recovery.md`
- **Exit Criteria:** See `skills/shared-patterns/exit-criteria.md`

## Exit Criteria

Interview is complete when ALL of these are true:

- [ ] All P0 (blocking) questions answered
- [ ] All P1 (architecture) questions answered
- [ ] Validated Understanding presented
- [ ] User explicitly confirmed understanding
- [ ] No remaining ambiguities that affect correctness

## Blocker Criteria

STOP and report if:

| Decision Type | Blocker Condition | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| Question Budget | Exceeded 3 rounds of questions without resolution | STOP and report - user may not have required information |
| Confirmation | User neither confirms nor denies understanding after 2 attempts | STOP and ask for explicit confirmation |
| Scope Creep | Interview reveals task is fundamentally different than expected | STOP and restart with new scope definition |
| Contradiction | User responses contradict each other | STOP and surface the contradiction for resolution |

### Cannot Be Overridden

The following requirements CANNOT be waived:
- MUST explore codebase before asking questions - asking without context wastes user time
- MUST provide concrete options (2-4 choices) - open-ended questions are FORBIDDEN
- MUST present Validated Understanding summary before proceeding
- CANNOT treat silence or ambiguous responses as confirmation

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Condition | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | P0 blocking question unanswered | MUST resolve before any implementation |
| HIGH | P1 architecture question unanswered | MUST resolve - affects overall structure |
| MEDIUM | P2 behavior question unanswered | Should resolve - affects user-facing functionality |
| LOW | P3 preference question unanswered | Can proceed with sensible default |

## Pressure Resistance

| User Says | Your Response |
|---|---|
| "Just start building, we'll figure it out" | "CANNOT proceed without resolving P0 and P1 questions. It's better to ask 5 questions upfront than rewrite code 3 times." |
| "I don't have time for all these questions" | "I MUST ask at least P0 blocking questions. Maximum 3 rounds, maximum 4 questions per round - this saves time versus incorrect implementation." |
| "You're the expert, just decide" | "CANNOT make architecture decisions without user input. I'll present 2-4 concrete options with trade-offs for you to choose." |

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| "User seems busy, I'll skip the interview" | Skipping requirements gathering causes rework. 5 upfront questions < 3 implementation rewrites. | **MUST complete interview for ambiguous requirements** |
| "I can infer what they want from context" | Inference creates assumptions. Explicit confirmation prevents misunderstanding. | **MUST get explicit answers, not infer intent** |
| "Open-ended question will give richer response" | Open-ended questions are hard to answer and produce vague responses. | **MUST provide 2-4 concrete options** |
| "User said 'sounds good' - that's confirmation" | 'Sounds good' is acknowledgment, not explicit confirmation. | **MUST get explicit 'confirmed' or 'proceed'** |

## Key Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Explore before asking** | 30 seconds of exploration can save a question |
| **Structured choices** | Use AskUserQuestion with 2-4 concrete options |
| **Show your work** | Include what you found and why you're uncertain |
| **Respect time** | Max 3 rounds, max 4 questions per round |
| **Confirm understanding** | Always present summary for validation |
| **Iterate if needed** | Unclear confirmation = ask follow-up |
