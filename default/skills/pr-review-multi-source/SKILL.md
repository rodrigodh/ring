  Adapted from alexgarzao/optimus (optimus-pr-review).

trigger: |
  - When user provides a PR URL for review (e.g., "review this PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123")
  - When user asks to review a pull request with multi-source comment analysis
  - When user wants to evaluate existing CodeRabbit or human review comments alongside fresh agent review

skip_when: |
  - No PR URL provided and user wants a generic code review (use ring:requesting-code-review directly)
  - PR is already merged or closed (nothing actionable to review)
  - User wants to run automated checks only (no interactive review needed)
  - User wants a code review without PR context (use ring:requesting-code-review)

NOT_skip_when: |
  - "The PR is small" → Small PRs still benefit from structured review with PR context and comment analysis.
  - "I already looked at the diff" → Specialist agents catch issues human review misses.
  - "CI passed" → CI checks automated rules; agents review logic, security, and quality.
  - "CodeRabbit already reviewed" → Agents validate/contest CodeRabbit findings and catch what it misses.
  - "Human reviewers already approved" → Agent review provides systematic coverage that human review may miss.

# PR Review Multi-Source

PR-aware code review orchestrator. Fetches PR metadata, collects existing review comments from all sources (CodeRabbit, human reviewers, CI), dispatches Ring's 7 specialized reviewer agents to evaluate both code and existing comments, and presents findings with source attribution.

## Phase 0: Fetch PR Context

### Step 0.1: Obtain PR URL

If the user provided a PR URL, use it directly.

If no URL was provided, attempt to find the PR for the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json url,number,title --jq '.url' 2>/dev/null
```

If no PR is found, inform the user that a PR URL is required.

### Step 0.2: Fetch PR Metadata

Use `gh pr view` to extract all relevant metadata:

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER_OR_URL> --json title,body,state,headRefName,baseRefName,changedFiles,additions,deletions,labels,milestone,assignees,reviewRequests,comments,url,number
```

**Guard: Check PR state.** If the PR state is `MERGED` or `CLOSED`, inform the user and STOP. Only open PRs should be reviewed.

If the command fails (invalid URL, PR not found, or permission denied), inform the user and ask for a corrected URL.

Extract and store:
- **Title and description** — the PR's purpose and context
- **Head branch and base branch** — for accurate diff
- **Changed files count** — scope indicator
- **Labels and milestone** — categorization context
- **Linked issues** — from PR description (look for "Fixes #", "Closes #", "Resolves #" patterns)

### Step 0.3: Collect Existing PR Comments

Collect ALL comments from ALL sources on the PR:

**General PR comments:**
```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER_OR_URL> --comments
```

**Review comments (inline code comments and review summaries):**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments
```

For each comment, extract and categorize:
- **Source:** Identify the author — CodeRabbit (bot), human reviewer (by username), CI/CD bot, or other automated tool
- **Type:** General comment, inline code comment, review summary, or approval/request-changes
- **File and line** (for inline comments) — map to the changed files
- **Content** — the actual feedback
- **Status:** Resolved/unresolved (if the platform tracks it)

**Duplicated comments sections:**
Some review tools (e.g., CodeRabbit) group repeated or similar comments under sections titled "Duplicated Comments" or similar headings. These contain valid feedback. You MUST:
1. Parse these sections and extract each individual comment
2. Treat them as regular review comments — do NOT skip them because they are labeled as "duplicated"
3. Map each duplicated comment to the affected files/lines listed in the section

Group comments by source:
```
PR Comments:
  - CodeRabbit: X comments (Y inline, Z summary, W from duplicated sections)
  - Human reviewers: X comments from [usernames]
  - CI/CD: X comments
  - Unresolved threads: X
```

### Step 0.4: Checkout PR Branch

Ensure the working tree matches the PR state:

```bash
gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER_OR_URL>
```

If already on the correct branch, skip this step. If checkout fails due to uncommitted changes, inform the user and ask them to stash or commit their changes first.

### Step 0.5: Fetch Changed Files

Get the list of files changed in the PR:

```bash
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER_OR_URL> --name-only
```

Read the full content of each changed file for the review agents.

Use TodoWrite to track progress through the phases.

---

## Phase 1: Present PR Summary

Present a summary of the PR to the user before starting the review:

```markdown
## PR Review: #<number> — <title>

**Branch:** <head> → <base>
**Changed files:** X files (+Y additions, -Z deletions)
**Labels:** [label1, label2]
**Linked issues:** #issue1, #issue2

### PR Description
<PR body/description>

### Existing Review Comments
- **CodeRabbit:** X comments (Y unresolved)
- **Human reviewers:** X comments from [usernames] (Y unresolved)
- **CI/CD:** X comments

### Changed Files
- file1.go
- file2.go
- file3_test.go
```

---

## Phase 2: Determine Review Type

Ask the user which type of review to run:

- **Initial** (5 agents) — correctness and critical gaps, suitable for in-progress PRs.
  Dispatches: ring:code-reviewer, ring:business-logic-reviewer, ring:security-reviewer, ring:test-reviewer, ring:nil-safety-reviewer
- **Final** (7 agents) — full coverage including ripple effects and dead code, suitable for PRs ready to merge.
  Dispatches all 7: adds ring:consequences-reviewer and ring:dead-code-reviewer

---

## Phase 3: Parallel Agent Dispatch

### Step 3.1: Discover Project Context

1. **Identify stack:** Check for `go.mod`, `package.json`, `Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
2. **Identify test commands:** Look in `Makefile`, `package.json` scripts, or CI config for lint, unit test, integration test, and E2E test commands
3. **Identify coding standards:** Look for `PROJECT_RULES.md`, linter configs, or equivalent
4. **Identify reference docs:** Look for PRD, TRD, API design, data model

Store discovered commands for use in the verification gate (Phase 7):
```
LINT_CMD=<discovered lint command>
TEST_UNIT_CMD=<discovered unit test command>
TEST_INTEGRATION_CMD=<discovered integration test command>
TEST_E2E_CMD=<discovered E2E test command>
```

### Step 3.2: Dispatch Agents

Dispatch ALL applicable agents simultaneously via the Task tool. Each agent receives:
- The full content of every changed file
- The PR context (description, linked issues)
- ALL existing PR comments (so agents can validate/contest them)
- Coding standards and reference docs

**Agent prompt MUST include:**

```
PR Context:
  - PR #<number>: <title>
  - Purpose: <PR description summary>
  - Linked issues: <list>
  - Base branch: <base>

Existing PR Comments (evaluate these — validate or contest each one):
  [paste all comments grouped by source, including comments from "Duplicated Comments" sections]

Review scope: Only the files changed in this PR.
Review type: Initial / Final.

Your job:
  1. Review the CODE for issues in your domain
  2. EVALUATE each existing PR comment in your domain:
     - AGREE: The comment is valid and should be addressed
     - CONTEST: The comment is incorrect or unnecessary (explain why)
     - ALREADY FIXED: The comment was addressed in a subsequent commit
  3. Report NEW findings not covered by existing comments

Required output format:
  ## New Findings
  For each: severity, file, line, description, recommendation

  ## Comment Evaluation
  For each existing comment in your domain:
  - Comment source and summary
  - Your verdict: AGREE / CONTEST / ALREADY FIXED
  - Justification
```

### Initial Review (5 agents)

| # | Agent | Focus |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | **ring:code-reviewer** | Architecture, design patterns, SOLID, DRY, maintainability |
| 2 | **ring:business-logic-reviewer** | Domain correctness, business rules, edge cases |
| 3 | **ring:security-reviewer** | Vulnerabilities, authentication, input validation, OWASP |
| 4 | **ring:test-reviewer** | Test coverage gaps, error scenarios, flaky patterns |
| 5 | **ring:nil-safety-reviewer** | Nil/null pointer safety, missing guards, panic paths |

### Final Review (7 agents — includes the 5 above plus)

| # | Agent | Focus |
|---|-------|-------|
| 6 | **ring:consequences-reviewer** | Ripple effects, caller chain impact, consumer contract integrity |
| 7 | **ring:dead-code-reviewer** | Orphaned code, dead dependencies, unreachable paths |

All agents MUST be dispatched in a SINGLE message with parallel Task calls.

---

## Phase 4: Consolidation

After ALL agents return:

1. **Merge** all new findings into a single list
2. **Merge** all comment evaluations into a single list
3. **Deduplicate** — if multiple agents flag the same issue, keep one entry and note which agents agreed
4. **Cross-reference** — for existing comments, note agreement/disagreement between agents and between agents and the original commenter
5. **Sort** by severity: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
6. **Assign** sequential IDs (F1, F2, F3...)

### Source Attribution

Each finding MUST include its source(s):

| Source Type | Label |
|-------------|-------|
| New finding from agent review | `[Agent: <agent-name>]` |
| Existing CodeRabbit comment validated by agent | `[CodeRabbit + Agent: <agent-name>]` |
| Existing human review comment validated by agent | `[Reviewer: <username> + Agent: <agent-name>]` |
| Existing comment contested by agent | `[Contested: <source> vs Agent: <agent-name>]` |

---

## Phase 5: Present Overview

```markdown
## PR Review: #<number> — X findings

### New Findings (from agents)
| # | Severity | File | Summary | Agent(s) |
|---|----------|------|---------|----------|

### Validated Existing Comments
| # | Severity | File | Original Source | Summary | Validating Agent(s) |
|---|----------|------|----------------|---------|---------------------|

### Contested Comments
| # | Original Source | Comment Summary | Contesting Agent | Reason |
|---|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|

### Summary
- New findings: X (C critical, H high, M medium, L low)
- Validated comments: X
- Contested comments: X
- Already fixed: X
```

---

## Phase 6: Interactive Finding-by-Finding Resolution (collect decisions only)

Process ONE finding at a time, in severity order (CRITICAL first, LOW last). Include both new findings and validated existing comments. Present contested comments for user decision.

For EACH finding, present:

### 1. Finding Header

`## [SEVERITY] F# | [Category]`
- Source(s): which agent(s) and/or external reviewer(s) flagged this
- Agreement: which sources agree/disagree

### 2. Problem Description

- Clear description of the issue with code snippet if applicable
- For validated existing comments: show the original comment and the agent's validation
- For contested comments: show both the original comment and the agent's contestation
- Why it matters — what breaks, what risk it creates

### 3. Proposed Solutions

One or more approaches, each with:
- What changes
- Tradeoffs (complexity, performance, breaking changes)
- If it's a straightforward fix with no tradeoffs, state: "Direct fix, no tradeoffs."

Include a recommendation when one option is clearly better.

### 4. Wait for User Decision

**BLOCKING**: Do NOT advance to the next finding until the user decides.

The user may:
- Approve an option (e.g., "A", "B")
- Request more context
- Discard the finding
- Defer to a future version
- Group with the next finding if related

### 5. Record Decision

Internally record every decision: finding ID, source(s), chosen option (or "skip"/"defer"), and rationale if provided. Do NOT apply any fix yet — fixes are batched in Phase 7.

Use TodoWrite to track each finding's resolution status.

---

## Phase 7: Batch Apply All Approved Fixes

**IMPORTANT:** This phase starts ONLY after ALL findings have been presented and ALL decisions collected. No fix is applied during Phase 6.

### Step 7.1: Present Pre-Apply Summary

Before touching any code, show the user a summary of everything that will be changed:

```markdown
## Fixes to Apply (X of Y findings)

| # | Finding | Source | Decision | Files Affected |
|---|---------|--------|----------|---------------|
| F1 | [summary] | [Agent + CodeRabbit] | Option A | file1.go |
| F3 | [summary] | [Agent: Security] | Option B | auth.go |

### Skipped (Z findings)
| # | Finding | Source | Reason |
|---|---------|--------|--------|
| F2 | [summary] | [Reviewer: john] | User: out of scope |

### Deferred (W findings)
| # | Finding | Source | Destination |
|---|---------|--------|-------------|
| F5 | [summary] | [Agent: QA] | Backlog |
```

### Step 7.2: Apply All Fixes

Apply ALL approved fixes in a single pass:

1. Group fixes by file to minimize file I/O
2. Apply all changes
3. Run lint — if format issues, fix and re-run
4. Run unit tests — if failures, diagnose and fix (max 3 attempts per failure)
5. If a fix causes test failures after 3 attempts, revert that specific fix, present the failure to the user, and ask for guidance

### Step 7.3: Verification Gate

After all fixes applied, run the full gate using discovered project commands:
- Always run lint and unit tests
- If backend files were changed: also run integration tests
- If frontend files were changed: also run E2E tests (if available)

All commands MUST pass before proceeding to Phase 8.

---

## Phase 8: Final Summary

```markdown
## PR Review Summary: #<number> — <title>

### Sources Analyzed
- CodeRabbit comments: X evaluated (Y validated, Z contested)
- Human reviewer comments: X evaluated (Y validated, Z contested)
- New agent findings: X
- Already fixed: X

### Fixed (X findings)
| # | Source | File(s) | Fix Applied |
|---|--------|---------|-------------|

### Skipped (X findings)
| # | Source | File(s) | Reason |
|---|--------|---------|--------|

### Deferred (X findings)
| # | Source | File(s) | Destination |
|---|--------|---------|-------------|

### Verification
- Lint: PASS
- Unit tests: PASS (X tests)
- Integration tests: PASS / SKIPPED
- E2E tests: PASS / SKIPPED

### PR Readiness
- [ ] All CRITICAL/HIGH findings resolved
- [ ] Changes align with PR description and linked issues
- [ ] No unrelated changes included in the PR
- [ ] Test coverage adequate for the changes

**Verdict:** READY FOR MERGE / NEEDS CHANGES
```

**Do NOT commit automatically.** Present the summary and ask the user if they want to commit.

---

## Phase 9: Respond to PR Comments

After the user commits (or explicitly skips commit), respond to each existing PR comment thread that was evaluated during the review.

### Step 9.1: Identify Comment Threads to Respond

For each existing PR comment that was evaluated by agents, determine the appropriate response based on the user's decision:

| Decision | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Fixed** | Reply with the commit SHA and mark as resolved |
| **Skipped/Discarded** | Reply explaining why it won't be fixed |
| **Deferred** | Reply explaining it was deferred and where it was tracked |
| **Contested** | Reply explaining why the comment was contested |
| **Already fixed** | Reply noting it was already addressed |

### Step 9.2: Post Replies and Resolve Threads

For each comment thread, post the reply AND resolve the conversation on GitHub:

**For inline review comments (most common):**
```bash
# Post the reply
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  --method POST \
  -f body="<reply>" \
  -F in_reply_to=<comment_id>
```

**For general PR comments:**
```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER_OR_URL> --body "<reply>"
```

**Resolve the conversation thread** (for review comment threads):
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "<thread_node_id>"}) {
      thread { isResolved }
    }
  }
'
```

To get the thread node ID, query the PR's review threads:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    repository(owner: "<owner>", name: "<repo>") {
      pullRequest(number: <number>) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            comments(first: 1) {
              nodes { body databaseId }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
'
```

Match each thread by its first comment's `databaseId` to the `comment_id` collected in Step 0.3, then resolve using the thread's `id`.

### Step 9.3: Reply Templates

**Fixed:**
```
Fixed in <commit_sha>.
```

**Skipped/Discarded:**
```
Won't fix: <user's reason or rationale>.
```

**Deferred:**
```
Deferred to <destination> (e.g., backlog, future PR): <brief reason>.
```

**Contested:**
```
Contested: <agent's reasoning for why the comment is incorrect or unnecessary>.
```

**Already fixed:**
```
Already addressed in a previous commit.
```

### Step 9.4: Present Reply Summary

After posting all replies, present a summary:

```markdown
### PR Comment Replies Posted
| # | Thread | Source | Reply | Status |
|---|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | file.go:42 | CodeRabbit | Fixed in abc1234 | Resolved |
| 2 | file.go:88 | @reviewer | Won't fix: out of scope | Closed |
| 3 | general | CodeRabbit | Deferred to backlog | Closed |
```

---

## Rules

- MUST fetch PR metadata AND existing comments before starting the review
- Agents MUST evaluate existing comments — validate, contest, or mark as already fixed
- Every finding MUST include source attribution (agent, CodeRabbit, human reviewer)
- MUST NOT review files outside the PR scope — only files changed in the PR
- MUST include PR description, linked issues, and existing comments in every agent prompt
- One finding at a time, severity order (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
- No changes without prior user approval — the user decides the approach
- Fixes are collected during Phase 6 and applied in batch during Phase 7
- MUST NOT merge the PR — only review and present findings
- MUST NOT commit fixes without explicit user approval
- After commit, MUST reply to every existing PR comment thread with resolution status
- If `gh` CLI is not installed, inform the user and suggest installation (e.g., `brew install gh` on macOS). If installed but not authenticated, ask the user to run `gh auth login`
