Cancel the current development cycle.

## Usage

```
/ring:dev-cancel [--force]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--force` | Cancel without confirmation |

## Behavior

1. **Confirmation**: Asks for confirmation before canceling (unless `--force`)
2. **State preservation**: Saves current state for potential resume
3. **Cleanup**: Marks cycle as `cancelled` in state file
4. **Report**: Generates partial feedback report with completed tasks

## Example

```
⚠️ Cancel Development Cycle?

Cycle ID: 2024-01-15-143000
Progress: 3/5 tasks completed

This will:
- Stop the current cycle
- Save state for potential resume
- Generate partial feedback report

[Confirm Cancel] [Keep Running]
```

After confirmation:

```
