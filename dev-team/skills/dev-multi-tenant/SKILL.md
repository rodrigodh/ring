  Multi-tenant development cycle orchestrator following Ring Standards.
  Auto-detects the service stack (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, S3)
  and service type (plugin vs product),
  then executes a gate-based implementation using tenantId from JWT
  for database-per-tenant isolation via lib-commons v3 tenant-manager sub-packages (postgres.Manager, mongo.Manager).
  For plugins: includes mandatory M2M credential retrieval from AWS Secrets Manager
  via lib-commons v3 secretsmanager package (per-tenant authentication with product APIs).
  MUST update lib-commons v3 first; lib-auth v2 depends on it. Both are required dependencies.
  Each gate dispatches ring:backend-engineer-golang with context and section references.
  The agent loads multi-tenant.md via WebFetch and has all code examples.

trigger: |
  - User requests multi-tenant implementation for a Go service
  - User asks to add tenant isolation to an existing service
  - Task mentions "multi-tenant", "tenant isolation", "tenant-manager", "postgres.Manager", "MultiPoolMiddleware"

prerequisite: |
  - Go service with existing single-tenant functionality

NOT_skip_when: |
  - "organization_id already exists" → organization_id is NOT multi-tenant. tenantId via JWT is required.
  - "Just need to connect the wiring" → Multi-tenant requires lib-commons v3 tenant-manager sub-packages.
  - "lib-commons v3 upgrade is too risky" → REQUIRES lib-commons v3 tenant-manager sub-packages. No v3 = no multi-tenant.

# Multi-Tenant Development Cycle

<cannot_skip>

## CRITICAL: This Skill ORCHESTRATES. Agents IMPLEMENT.

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **This Skill** | Detect stack, determine gates, pass context to agent, verify outputs, enforce order |
| **ring:backend-engineer-golang** | Load multi-tenant.md via WebFetch, implement following the standards |
| **6 reviewers** | Review at Gate 9 |

**CANNOT change scope:** the skill defines WHAT to implement. The agent implements HOW.

**FORBIDDEN: Orchestrator MUST NOT use Edit, Write, or Bash tools to modify source code files.**
All code changes MUST go through `Task(subagent_type="ring:backend-engineer-golang")`.
The orchestrator only verifies outputs (grep, go build, go test) — MUST NOT write implementation code.

**MANDATORY: TDD for all implementation gates (Gates 2-6).** MUST follow RED → GREEN → REFACTOR: write a failing test first, then implement to make it pass, then refactor for clarity/performance. MUST include in every dispatch: "Follow TDD: write failing test (RED), implement to make it pass (GREEN), then refactor for clarity/performance (REFACTOR)."

</cannot_skip>

---

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Multi-tenant isolation is 100% based on `tenantId` from JWT → tenant-manager middleware → database-per-tenant. Connection managers (`postgres.Manager`, `mongo.Manager`, `rabbitmq.Manager`) resolve tenant-specific credentials via the Tenant Manager API. `organization_id` is NOT part of multi-tenant.

**Standards reference:** All code examples and implementation patterns are in [multi-tenant.md](../../docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md). MUST load via WebFetch before implementing any gate.

**WebFetch URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md`

### MANDATORY: Canonical Environment Variables

These are the only valid multi-tenant environment variables. MUST NOT use any other names (e.g., `TENANT_MANAGER_ADDRESS` is WRONG — the correct name is `MULTI_TENANT_URL`).

| Env Var | Description | Default | Required |
|---------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED` | Enable multi-tenant mode | `false` | Yes |
| `MULTI_TENANT_URL` | Tenant Manager service URL | - | If multi-tenant |
| `MULTI_TENANT_ENVIRONMENT` | Deployment environment for cache key segmentation (lazy consumer tenant discovery) | `staging` | Only if RabbitMQ |
| `MULTI_TENANT_MAX_TENANT_POOLS` | Soft limit for tenant connection pools (LRU eviction) | `100` | No |
| `MULTI_TENANT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | Seconds before idle tenant connection is eviction-eligible | `300` | No |
| `MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` | Consecutive failures before circuit breaker opens | `5` | Yes |
| `MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_SEC` | Seconds before circuit breaker resets (half-open) | `30` | Yes |

HARD GATE: Any env var outside this table is non-compliant. Agent MUST NOT invent or accept alternative names.

### MANDATORY: Canonical Metrics

These are the only valid multi-tenant metrics. All 4 are required.

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `tenant_connections_total` | Counter | Total tenant connections created |
| `tenant_connection_errors_total` | Counter | Connection failures per tenant |
| `tenant_consumers_active` | Gauge | Active message consumers |
| `tenant_messages_processed_total` | Counter | Messages processed per tenant |

When `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false`, metrics MUST use no-op implementations (zero overhead in single-tenant mode).

### MANDATORY: Circuit Breaker

The Tenant Manager HTTP client MUST enable `WithCircuitBreaker`. MUST NOT create the client without it.

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` | `5` | Consecutive failures before circuit opens |
| `MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `30` | Seconds before circuit resets (half-open) |

HARD GATE: A client without circuit breaker can cascade failures across all tenants.

### MANDATORY: Agent Instruction (include in EVERY gate dispatch)

MUST include these instructions in every dispatch to `ring:backend-engineer-golang`:

> **STANDARDS: WebFetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md` and follow the sections referenced below. All code examples, patterns, and implementation details are in that document. Use them as-is.**
>
> **TDD: For implementation gates (2-6), follow TDD methodology — write a failing test first (RED), then implement to make it pass (GREEN). MUST have test coverage for every change.**

---

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Cross-tenant data leak, security vulnerability | Tenant A sees Tenant B data, missing tenant validation, hardcoded creds |
| **HIGH** | Missing tenant isolation, wrong env vars | No TenantMiddleware, TENANT_MANAGER_ADDRESS instead of MULTI_TENANT_URL |
| **MEDIUM** | Configuration gaps, partial implementation | Missing circuit breaker, incomplete metrics |
| **LOW** | Documentation, optimization | Missing env var comments, pool tuning |

MUST report all severities. CRITICAL: STOP immediately (security breach). HIGH: Fix before gate pass. MEDIUM: Fix in iteration. LOW: Document.

---

## Pressure Resistance

| User Says | This Is | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| "Skip the lib-commons upgrade" | QUALITY_BYPASS | "CANNOT proceed without lib-commons v3. Tenant-manager sub-packages do not exist in v2." |
| "Just do the happy path, skip backward compat" | SCOPE_REDUCTION | "Backward compatibility is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Single-tenant deployments depend on it." |
| "organization_id is our tenant identifier" | AUTHORITY_OVERRIDE | "STOP. organization_id is NOT multi-tenant. tenantId from JWT is the only mechanism." |
| "Skip code review, we tested it" | QUALITY_BYPASS | "MANDATORY: 6 reviewers. One security mistake = cross-tenant data leak." |
| "We don't need RabbitMQ multi-tenant" | SCOPE_REDUCTION | "MUST execute Gate 6 if RabbitMQ was detected. CANNOT skip detected stack." |
| "I'll make a quick edit directly" | CODE_BYPASS | "FORBIDDEN: All code changes go through ring:backend-engineer-golang. Dispatch the agent." |
| "It's just one line, no need for an agent" | CODE_BYPASS | "FORBIDDEN: Even single-line changes MUST be dispatched. Agent ensures standards compliance." |
| "Agent is slow, I'll edit faster" | CODE_BYPASS | "FORBIDDEN: Speed is not a justification. Agent applies TDD and standards checks." |
| "This plugin doesn't need Secret Manager" | SCOPE_REDUCTION | "If it's a plugin with MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=true that calls product APIs, M2M via Secret Manager is MANDATORY." |
| "We can use env vars for M2M credentials" | SECURITY_BYPASS | "Env vars are shared across tenants. M2M credentials are PER-TENANT. MUST use Secrets Manager." |
| "Caching M2M credentials is optional" | QUALITY_BYPASS | "Every request to AWS adds ~50-100ms latency + cost. Caching is MANDATORY from day one." |

## Gate 0: Stack Detection

**Orchestrator executes directly. No agent dispatch.**

```text
DETECT (run in parallel):

1. lib-commons version:  grep "lib-commons" go.mod
1b. lib-auth v2:         grep "lib-auth" go.mod
2. PostgreSQL:           grep -rn "postgresql\|pgx\|squirrel" internal/ go.mod
3. MongoDB:              grep -rn "mongodb\|mongo" internal/ go.mod
4. Redis:                grep -rn "redis\|valkey" internal/ go.mod
5. RabbitMQ:             grep -rn "rabbitmq\|amqp" internal/ go.mod
6. S3/Object Storage:    grep -rn "s3\|ObjectStorage\|PutObject\|GetObject\|Upload.*storage\|Download.*storage" internal/ pkg/ go.mod
7. Existing multi-tenant:
   - Config:     grep -rn "MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED" internal/
   - Middleware: grep -rn "tenant-manager/middleware\|WithTenantDB\|MultiPoolMiddleware" internal/
   - Context:    grep -rn "tenant-manager/core\|GetMongoForTenant\|GetPostgresForTenant" internal/
   - S3 keys:    grep -rn "tenant-manager/s3\|GetObjectStorageKeyForTenant" internal/
   - RMQ:        grep -rn "X-Tenant-ID" internal/
8. Service type (plugin vs product):
   - Plugin:     grep -rn "plugin-\|Plugin" go.mod cmd/ internal/bootstrap/
   - M2M client: grep -rn "client_credentials\|M2M\|secretsmanager\|GetM2MCredentials" internal/ pkg/
   - Product API calls: grep -rn "ledger.*client\|midaz.*client\|product.*client" internal/
```

**Service type classification:**

| Signal | Classification |
|--------|---------------|
| Module name contains `plugin-` (in go.mod) | **Plugin** → Gate 5.5 MANDATORY |
| Service calls product APIs (ledger, midaz, etc.) | **Plugin** → Gate 5.5 MANDATORY |
| No product API calls, serves own data | **Product** → Gate 5.5 SKIP |

MUST confirm with user: "Is this service a **plugin** (calls product APIs like ledger/midaz) or a **product** (serves its own data)?"

MUST confirm: user explicitly approves detection results before proceeding.

---

## Gate 1: Codebase Analysis (Multi-Tenant Focus)

**Always executes. This gate builds the implementation roadmap for all subsequent gates.**

**Dispatch `ring:codebase-explorer` with multi-tenant-focused context:**

> TASK: Analyze this codebase exclusively under the multi-tenant perspective.
> DETECTED STACK: {databases and messaging from Gate 0}
>
> CRITICAL: Multi-tenant is ONLY about tenantId from JWT → tenant-manager middleware → database-per-tenant.
> IGNORE organization_id completely — it is NOT multi-tenant. A tenant can have multiple organizations inside its database. organization_id is a domain entity, not a tenant identifier.
>
> FOCUS AREAS (explore ONLY these — ignore everything else):
>
> 1. **Service name, modules, and components**: What is the service called? (Look for `const ApplicationName`.) How many components/modules does it have? Each module needs a constant (e.g., `const ModuleManager = "manager"`). Identify: service name (ApplicationName), module names per component, and whether constants exist or need to be created. Hierarchy: Service → Module → Resource.
> 2. **Bootstrap/initialization**: Where does the service start? Where are database connections created? Where is the middleware chain registered? Identify the exact insertion point for TenantMiddleware.
> 3. **Database connections**: How do repositories get their DB connection today? Static field in struct? Constructor injection? Context? List EVERY repository file with file:line showing where the connection is obtained.
> 4. **Middleware chain**: What middleware exists and in what order? Where would TenantMiddleware fit (after auth, before handlers)?
> 5. **Config struct**: Where is the Config struct? What fields exist? Where is it loaded? Identify exact location for MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED vars.
> 6. **RabbitMQ** (if detected): Where are producers? Where are consumers? How are messages published? Where would X-Tenant-ID header be injected? Are producer and consumer in the SAME process or SEPARATE components? Is there already a config split? Are there dual constructors? Is there a RabbitMQManager pool? Does the service struct have both consumer types?
> 7. **Redis** (if detected): Where are Redis operations? Any Lua scripts? Where would GetKeyFromContext be needed?
> 8. **S3/Object Storage** (if detected): Where are Upload/Download/Delete operations? How are object keys constructed? List every file:line that builds an S3 key. What bucket env var is used?
> 9. **Existing multi-tenant code**: Any tenant-manager sub-package imports (`tenant-manager/core`, `tenant-manager/middleware`, `tenant-manager/postgres`, etc.)? TenantMiddleware or MultiPoolMiddleware? `core.GetPostgresForTenant`/`core.GetMongoForTenant`/`s3.GetObjectStorageKeyForTenant` calls? MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED config? (NOTE: organization_id is NOT related to multi-tenant — ignore it completely)
> 10. **M2M / Plugin authentication** (if service is a plugin): Does the service call product APIs (ledger, midaz, CRM)? How does it authenticate today (static token, env var, hardcoded)? Where is the HTTP client that calls the product? Is there an existing M2M or `client_credentials` flow? Any `secretsmanager` imports? List every file:line where product API calls are made and where authentication credentials are injected.
>
> OUTPUT FORMAT: Structured report with file:line references for every point above.
> DO NOT write code. Analysis only.

**The explorer produces a gap summary.** For the full checklist of required items, see [multi-tenant.md § Checklist](../../docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md).

**This report becomes the CONTEXT for all subsequent gates.**

<block_condition>
HARD GATE: MUST complete the analysis report before proceeding. All subsequent gates use this report to know exactly what to change.
</block_condition>

MUST ensure backward compatibility context: the analysis MUST identify how the service works today in single-tenant mode, so subsequent gates preserve this behavior when `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false`.

---

## Gate 1.5: Implementation Preview (Visual Report)

**Always executes. This gate generates a visual HTML report showing exactly what will change before any code is written.**

**Uses the `ring:visual-explainer` skill to produce a self-contained HTML page.**

The report is built from Gate 0 (stack detection) and Gate 1 (codebase analysis). It shows the developer a complete preview of every change that will be made across all subsequent gates, with backward compatibility analysis.

**Orchestrator generates the report using `ring:visual-explainer` with this content:**

The HTML page MUST include these sections:

### 1. Current Architecture (Before)
- Mermaid diagram showing current request flow (how connections work today in single-tenant mode)
- Table of all files that will be modified, with current line counts
- How repositories get DB connections today (static field, constructor injection, etc.)

### 2. Target Architecture (After)
- Mermaid diagram showing the multi-tenant request flow (JWT → middleware → tenant pool → handler)
- Which middleware will be used: `TenantMiddleware` (single-module) or `MultiPoolMiddleware` (multi-module)
- How repositories will get DB connections (context-based: `core.GetPostgresForTenant(ctx)`)

### 3. Change Map (per gate)
Table with columns: Gate, File, Current Code, New Code, Lines Changed. One row per file that will be modified. Example:

| Gate | File | What Changes | Impact |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| 2 | `go.mod` | lib-commons v2 → v3 + lib-auth v2, import paths | All files |
| 3 | `config.go` | Add the 7 canonical MULTI_TENANT_* env vars (see "Canonical Environment Variables" table above) to Config struct | ~20 lines added |
| 4 | `config.go` | Add TenantMiddleware/MultiPoolMiddleware setup | ~30 lines added |
| 4 | `routes.go` | Register middleware in Fiber chain | ~5 lines added |
| 5 | `organization.postgresql.go` | `c.connection.GetDB()` → `core.GetModulePostgresForTenant(ctx, module)` | ~3 lines per method |
| 5 | `metadata.mongodb.go` | Static mongo → `core.GetMongoForTenant(ctx)` | ~2 lines per method |
| 5 | `consumer.redis.go` | Key prefixing with `valkey.GetKeyFromContext(ctx, key)` | ~1 line per operation |
| 5 | `storage.go` | S3 key prefixing with `s3.GetObjectStorageKeyForTenant(ctx, key)` | ~1 line per operation |
| 5.5 | `m2m/provider.go` | New file: M2MCredentialProvider with credential caching (plugin only) | ~80 lines |
| 5.5 | `config.go` | Add M2M_TARGET_SERVICE, cache TTL, AWS_REGION env vars (plugin only) | ~10 lines added |
| 5.5 | `bootstrap.go` | Conditional M2M wiring when multi-tenant + plugin (plugin only) | ~20 lines added |
| 6 | `producer.rabbitmq.go` | Dual constructor (single-tenant + multi-tenant) | ~20 lines added |
| 6 | `rabbitmq.server.go` | MultiTenantConsumer setup with lazy mode | ~40 lines added |
| 7 | `config.go` | Backward compat validation | ~10 lines added |

**MANDATORY: Below the summary table, show per-file code diff panels for every file that will be modified.**

For each file in the change map, generate a before/after diff panel showing:
- **Before:** The exact current code from the codebase (sourced from the Gate 1 analysis)
- **After:** The exact code that will be written (following multi-tenant.md patterns)
- Use syntax highlighting and line numbers (read `default/skills/visual-explainer/templates/code-diff.html` for patterns)

Example diff panel for a repository file:

```go
// BEFORE: organization.postgresql.go
func (r *OrganizationPostgreSQLRepository) Create(ctx context.Context, org *Organization) error {
    db := r.connection.GetDB()
    result := db.Model(&OrganizationPostgreSQLModel{}).Create(toModel(org))
    // ...
}

// AFTER: organization.postgresql.go
func (r *OrganizationPostgreSQLRepository) Create(ctx context.Context, org *Organization) error {
    db, err := core.GetModulePostgresForTenant(ctx, "organization")
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("getting tenant db for organization: %w", err)
    }
    result := db.Model(&OrganizationPostgreSQLModel{}).Create(toModel(org))
    // ...
}
```

The developer MUST be able to see the exact code that will be implemented to approve it. High-level descriptions alone are not sufficient for approval.

**When many files have identical changes** (e.g., 10+ repository files all changing `r.connection.GetDB()` to `core.GetPostgresForTenant(ctx)`): show one representative diff panel, then list the remaining files with "Same pattern applied to: [file list]."

### 4. Backward Compatibility Analysis

**MANDATORY: Show complete conditional initialization code, not just the if/else skeleton.**

For each component (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, S3), show:
1. **Current initialization code** (exact lines from codebase, sourced from Gate 1)
2. **New initialization code** with the `if cfg.MultiTenantEnabled` branch
3. **Explicit callout:** "When MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false, execution follows the ELSE branch which is IDENTICAL to current behavior"

Side-by-side comparison showing:
- **MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false (default):** Exact current behavior preserved. No JWT parsing, no Tenant Manager calls, no pool routing. Middleware calls `c.Next()` immediately.
- **MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=true:** New behavior with tenant isolation.

Code diff showing the complete conditional initialization (not skeleton):
```go
if cfg.MultiTenantEnabled && cfg.MultiTenantURL != "" {
    // Multi-tenant path (NEW)
    tmClient := client.NewClient(cfg.MultiTenantURL, logger, clientOpts...)
    pgManager := postgres.NewManager(tmClient, logger)
    // ... show complete initialization
} else {
    // Single-tenant path (UNCHANGED — exactly how it works today)
    // Show the exact same constructor calls that exist in the current codebase
    logger.Info("Running in SINGLE-TENANT MODE")
}
```

Show the middleware bypass explicitly:
```go
// When MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false, TenantMiddleware is NOT registered.
// Requests flow directly to handlers without any JWT parsing or tenant resolution.
```

The developer MUST understand that:
- No new code paths execute in single-tenant mode
- The `else` branch preserves the exact current constructor calls
- No additional dependencies are loaded when disabled
- No performance impact when disabled (middleware calls c.Next() immediately)

### 5. New Dependencies
Table showing what gets added to go.mod and which sub-packages are imported:
- `tenant-manager/core` — types, errors, context helpers
- `tenant-manager/client` — Tenant Manager HTTP client
- `tenant-manager/middleware` — TenantMiddleware or MultiPoolMiddleware
- `tenant-manager/postgres` — PostgresManager (if PG detected)
- `tenant-manager/mongo` — MongoManager (if Mongo detected)
- etc.

### 6. Environment Variables
The exact 7 canonical env vars from the "Canonical Environment Variables" table (MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED, MULTI_TENANT_URL, MULTI_TENANT_ENVIRONMENT, MULTI_TENANT_MAX_TENANT_POOLS, MULTI_TENANT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC, MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD, MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_SEC). MUST NOT use alternative names.

### 7. Risk Assessment
Table with: Risk, Mitigation, Verification. Examples:
- Single-tenant regression → Backward compat gate (Gate 7) → `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false go test ./...`
- Cross-tenant data leak → Context-based isolation → Tenant isolation integration tests (Gate 8)
- Startup performance → Lazy consumer mode → `consumer.Run(ctx)` returns in <1s

### 8. Retro Compatibility Guarantee

Explicit explanation of backward compatibility strategy:

**Method:** Feature flag with `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED` environment variable (default: `false`).

**Guarantee:** When `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false`:
- No tenant middleware is registered in the HTTP chain
- No JWT parsing or tenant resolution occurs
- All database connections use the original static constructors
- All Redis keys are unprefixed (original behavior)
- All S3 keys are unprefixed (original behavior)
- RabbitMQ connects directly at startup (original behavior)
- `go test ./...` passes with zero changes to existing tests

**Verification (Gate 7):** The agent MUST run `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false go test ./...` and verify all existing tests pass unchanged.

**Output:** Save the HTML report to `docs/multi-tenant-preview.html` in the project root.

**Open in browser** for the developer to review.

<block_condition>
HARD GATE: Developer MUST explicitly approve the implementation preview before any code changes begin. This prevents wasted effort on misunderstood requirements or incorrect architectural decisions.
</block_condition>

**If the developer requests changes to the preview, regenerate the report and re-confirm.**

---

## Gate 2: lib-commons v3 + lib-auth v2 Upgrade

**SKIP IF:** already lib-commons v3 AND lib-auth v2.

**Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` with context:**

> TASK: Upgrade lib-commons to v3 first, then update lib-auth to v2 (lib-auth v2 depends on lib-commons v3).
> For both libraries, fetch the latest tag (may be beta/rc in dev).
> Check latest tags: `git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons.git | tail -5` and `git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/LerianStudio/lib-auth.git | tail -5`
> Run in order:
> 1. `go get github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v3@{latest-tag}`
> 2. `go get github.com/LerianStudio/lib-auth/v2@{latest-tag}`
> Update go.mod and all import paths from v2 to v3 for lib-commons.
> Follow multi-tenant.md section "Required lib-commons Version".
> DO NOT implement multi-tenant code yet — only upgrade the dependencies.
> Verify: go build ./... and go test ./... MUST pass.

**Verification:** `grep "lib-commons/v3" go.mod` + `grep "lib-auth/v2" go.mod` + `go build ./...` + `go test ./...`

<block_condition>
HARD GATE: MUST pass build and tests before proceeding.
</block_condition>

---

## Gate 3: Multi-Tenant Configuration

**SKIP IF:** config already has `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED`.

**Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` with context from Gate 1 analysis:**

> TASK: Add the 7 canonical multi-tenant environment variables to the Config struct.
> CONTEXT FROM GATE 1: {Config struct location and current fields from analysis report}
> Follow multi-tenant.md sections "Environment Variables", "Configuration", and "Conditional Initialization".
>
> The EXACT env vars to add (no alternatives allowed):
> - MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED (bool, default false)
> - MULTI_TENANT_URL (string, required when enabled)
> - MULTI_TENANT_ENVIRONMENT (string, default "staging", only if RabbitMQ)
> - MULTI_TENANT_MAX_TENANT_POOLS (int, default 100)
> - MULTI_TENANT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC (int, default 300)
> - MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD (int, default 5)
> - MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_SEC (int, default 30)
>
> MUST NOT use alternative names (e.g., TENANT_MANAGER_ADDRESS, TENANT_MANAGER_URL are WRONG).
> Add conditional log: "Multi-tenant mode enabled" vs "Running in SINGLE-TENANT MODE".
> DO NOT implement TenantMiddleware yet — only configuration.

**Verification:** `grep "MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED" internal/bootstrap/config.go` + `go build ./...`

---

## Gate 4: TenantMiddleware (Core)

**SKIP IF:** middleware already exists.

**This is the CORE gate. Without TenantMiddleware, there is no tenant isolation.**

**Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` with context from Gate 1 analysis:**

## Gate 5: Repository Adaptation

**SKIP IF:** repositories already use context-based connections.

**Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` with context from Gate 1 analysis:**

> TASK: Adapt all repository implementations to get database connections from tenant context instead of static connections. Also adapt S3/object storage operations to prefix keys with tenant ID.
> DETECTED STACK: {postgresql: Y/N, mongodb: Y/N, redis: Y/N, s3: Y/N} (from Gate 0)
> CONTEXT FROM GATE 1: {List of ALL repository files and storage operations with file:line from analysis report}
>
> Follow multi-tenant.md sections:
> - "Database Connection in Repositories" (PostgreSQL)
> - "MongoDB Multi-Tenant Repository" (MongoDB)
> - "Redis Key Prefixing" and "Redis Key Prefixing for Lua Scripts" (Redis)
> - "S3/Object Storage Key Prefixing" (S3)
>
> MUST work in both modes: multi-tenant (prefixed keys / context connections) and single-tenant (unchanged keys / default connections).

**Verification:** grep for `core.GetPostgresForTenant` / `core.GetMongoForTenant` / `core.GetModulePostgresForTenant` (multi-module) / `valkey.GetKeyFromContext` / `s3.GetObjectStorageKeyForTenant` in `internal/` + `go build ./...`

## Gate 5.5: M2M Secret Manager (Plugin Auth)

**SKIP IF:** service is NOT a plugin (i.e., it is a product or infrastructure service).

**This gate is MANDATORY for plugins** that need to authenticate with product APIs (e.g., ledger, midaz) in multi-tenant mode. Each tenant has its own M2M credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

**Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` with context from Gate 0/1 analysis:**

> TASK: Implement M2M credential retrieval from AWS Secrets Manager with per-tenant caching.
> SERVICE TYPE: Plugin (confirmed in Gate 0)
> APPLICATION NAME: {ApplicationName constant from codebase, e.g., "plugin-pix"}
> TARGET SERVICE: {product the plugin calls, e.g., "ledger", "midaz"}
>
> Follow multi-tenant.md section "M2M Credentials via Secret Manager (Plugin-Only)" for all implementation patterns.
>
> **What to implement:**
>
> 1. **M2M Authenticator struct** with credential caching (`sync.Map`) and token caching.
>    Use `secretsmanager.GetM2MCredentials()` from `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v3/commons/secretsmanager`.
>    The function signature is:
>    ```go
>    secretsmanager.GetM2MCredentials(ctx, smClient, env, tenantOrgID, applicationName, targetService) (*M2MCredentials, error)
>    ```
>    It returns `*M2MCredentials{ClientID, ClientSecret}` fetched from path:
>    `tenants/{env}/{tenantOrgID}/{applicationName}/m2m/{targetService}/credentials`
>
> 2. **Credential cache** with configurable TTL (default 300s). MUST NOT hit AWS on every request.
>
> 3. **Bootstrap wiring** — conditional on `cfg.MultiTenantEnabled`:
>    ```go
>    if cfg.MultiTenantEnabled {
>        awsCfg, _ := awsconfig.LoadDefaultConfig(ctx)
>        smClient := awssm.NewFromConfig(awsCfg)
>        m2mProvider := m2m.NewM2MCredentialProvider(smClient, cfg.MultiTenantEnvironment,
>            constant.ApplicationName, cfg.M2MTargetService,
>            time.Duration(cfg.M2MCredentialCacheTTLSec)*time.Second)
>        productClient = product.NewClient(cfg.ProductURL, m2mProvider)
>    } else {
>        productClient = product.NewClient(cfg.ProductURL, nil) // single-tenant: static auth
>    }
>    ```
>
> 4. **Config env vars** — add to Config struct:
>    - `M2M_TARGET_SERVICE` (string, required for plugins)
>    - `M2M_CREDENTIAL_CACHE_TTL_SEC` (int, default 300)
>    - `AWS_REGION` (string, required for plugins)
>
> 6. **Error handling** using sentinel errors from lib-commons:
>    - `secretsmanager.ErrM2MCredentialsNotFound` → tenant not provisioned
>    - `secretsmanager.ErrM2MVaultAccessDenied` → IAM issue, alert ops
>    - `secretsmanager.ErrM2MInvalidCredentials` → secret malformed, alert ops
>
> **SECURITY:**
> - MUST NOT log clientId or clientSecret values
> - MUST NOT store credentials in environment variables (fetch from Secrets Manager at runtime)
> - MUST cache locally to avoid per-request AWS API calls
> - MUST handle credential rotation via cache TTL expiry

**Verification:** `grep "secretsmanager.GetM2MCredentials\|M2MAuthenticator\|NewM2MAuthenticator" internal/` + `go build ./...`

<block_condition>
HARD GATE: If service is a plugin and MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=true, M2M Secret Manager integration is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The plugin cannot authenticate with product APIs without it.
</block_condition>

## Gate 6: RabbitMQ Multi-Tenant

**SKIP IF:** no RabbitMQ detected.

**Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` with context from Gate 1 analysis:**

> TASK: Implement RabbitMQ multi-tenant patterns with lazy initialization.
> CONTEXT FROM GATE 1: {Producer and consumer file:line locations from analysis report}
> DETECTED ARCHITECTURE: {Are producer and consumer in the same process or separate components?}
>
> Follow multi-tenant.md sections:
> - "RabbitMQ Multi-Tenant Producer" for dual constructor and X-Tenant-ID header
> - "Multi-Tenant Message Queue Consumers (Lazy Mode)" for lazy initialization
> - "ConsumerTrigger Interface" for the trigger wiring
>
> Gate-specific constraints:
> 1. CONFIG SPLIT (MANDATORY): Branch on `cfg.MultiTenantEnabled` for both producer and consumer in bootstrap
> 2. MUST keep the existing single-tenant code path untouched
> 3. MUST NOT connect directly to RabbitMQ at startup in multi-tenant mode
> 4. X-Tenant-ID goes in AMQP headers, NOT in message body

**Verification:** `grep "tmrabbitmq.Manager\|NewProducerMultiTenant\|EnsureConsumerStarted\|tmmiddleware.ConsumerTrigger" internal/` + `go build ./...`

<block_condition>
HARD GATE: MUST NOT connect directly to RabbitMQ at startup in multi-tenant mode.
</block_condition>

---

## Gate 7: Metrics & Backward Compatibility

**Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` with context:**

> TASK: Add multi-tenant metrics and validate backward compatibility.
>
> Follow multi-tenant.md sections "Multi-Tenant Metrics" and "Single-Tenant Backward Compatibility Validation (MANDATORY)".
>
> The EXACT metrics to implement (no alternatives allowed):
> - `tenant_connections_total` (Counter) — Total tenant connections created
> - `tenant_connection_errors_total` (Counter) — Connection failures per tenant
> - `tenant_consumers_active` (Gauge) — Active message consumers
> - `tenant_messages_processed_total` (Counter) — Messages processed per tenant
>
> All 4 metrics are MANDATORY. When MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false, metrics MUST use no-op implementations (zero overhead).
>
> BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE:
> - MUST start without any MULTI_TENANT_* env vars
> - MUST start without Tenant Manager running
> - MUST pass all existing tests with MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false
> - Health/version endpoints MUST work without tenant context
>
> Write TestMultiTenant_BackwardCompatibility integration test.

**Verification:** `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false go test ./...` MUST pass.

<block_condition>
HARD GATE: Backward compatibility MUST pass.
</block_condition>

## Gate 8: Tests

**Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` with context:**

> TASK: Write multi-tenant tests.
> DETECTED STACK: {postgresql: Y/N, mongodb: Y/N, redis: Y/N, s3: Y/N, rabbitmq: Y/N} (from Gate 0)
>
> Follow multi-tenant.md section "Testing Multi-Tenant Code" (all subsections).
>
> Required tests: unit tests with mock tenant context, tenant isolation tests (two tenants, data separation), error case tests (missing JWT, tenant not found), plus RabbitMQ, Redis, and S3 tests if detected.

**Verification:** `go test ./... -v -count=1` + `go test ./... -cover`

---

## Gate 9: Code Review

**Dispatch 6 parallel reviewers (same pattern as ring:requesting-code-review).**

MUST include this context in ALL 6 reviewer dispatches:

> **MULTI-TENANT REVIEW CONTEXT:**
> - Multi-tenant isolation is based on `tenantId` from JWT → tenant-manager middleware (TenantMiddleware or MultiPoolMiddleware) → database-per-tenant.
> - `organization_id` is NOT a tenant identifier. It is a business filter within the tenant's database. A single tenant can have multiple organizations. Do NOT flag organization_id as a multi-tenant issue.
> - Backward compatibility is required: when `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false`, the service MUST work exactly as before (single-tenant mode, no tenant context needed).

| Reviewer | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| ring:code-reviewer | Architecture, lib-commons v3 usage, TenantMiddleware/MultiPoolMiddleware placement, sub-package usage |
| ring:business-logic-reviewer | Tenant context propagation via tenantId (NOT organization_id) |
| ring:security-reviewer | Cross-tenant DB isolation, JWT tenantId validation, no data leaks between tenant databases |
| ring:test-reviewer | Coverage, isolation tests between two tenants, backward compat tests |
| ring:nil-safety-reviewer | Nil risks in tenant context extraction from JWT and context getters |
| ring:consequences-reviewer | Impact on single-tenant paths, backward compat when MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false |

MUST pass all 6 reviewers. Critical findings → fix and re-review.

## Gate 11: Activation Guide

**MUST generate `docs/multi-tenant-guide.md` in the project root.** Direct, concise, no filler text.

The file is built from Gate 0 (stack) and Gate 1 (analysis). See [multi-tenant.md § Checklist](../../docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md) for the canonical env var list and requirements.

<!-- Template: values filled from Gate 0/1 results. Canonical source: multi-tenant.md -->

The guide MUST include:
1. **Components table**: Component name, Service const, Module const, Resources, what was adapted
2. **Environment variables**: the 7 canonical MULTI_TENANT_* vars (MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED, MULTI_TENANT_URL, MULTI_TENANT_ENVIRONMENT, MULTI_TENANT_MAX_TENANT_POOLS, MULTI_TENANT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC, MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD, MULTI_TENANT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_SEC) with required/default/description
3. **M2M environment variables (plugin only)**: If the service is a plugin, include M2M_TARGET_SERVICE, M2M_CREDENTIAL_CACHE_TTL_SEC, AWS_REGION
4. **How to activate**: set envs + start alongside Tenant Manager (+ AWS credentials for plugins)
5. **How to verify**: check logs, test with JWT tenantId (+ verify M2M credential retrieval for plugins)
6. **How to deactivate**: set MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false
7. **Common errors**: see [multi-tenant.md § Error Handling](../../docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md)

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [multi-tenant.md](../../docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md) for the canonical anti-rationalization tables on tenantId vs organization_id.

**Skill-specific rationalizations:**

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Agent says out of scope" | Skill defines scope, not agent. | **Re-dispatch with gate context** |
| "Skip tests" | Gate 8 proves isolation works. | **MANDATORY** |
| "Skip review" | Security implications. One mistake = data leak. | **MANDATORY** |
| "Using TENANT_MANAGER_ADDRESS instead" | Non-standard name. Only the 7 canonical MULTI_TENANT_* vars are valid. | **STOP. Use MULTI_TENANT_URL** |
| "The service already uses a different env name" | Legacy names are non-compliant. Rename to canonical names. | **Replace with canonical env vars** |
| "Plugin doesn't need Secret Manager for M2M" | If multi-tenant is active, each tenant has different credentials. Env vars can't hold per-tenant secrets. | **MUST use Secret Manager for per-tenant M2M** |
| "We'll add M2M caching later" | Without caching, every request hits AWS (~50-100ms + cost). This is a production blocker. | **MUST implement caching from day one** |
| "Hardcoded credentials work for now" | Hardcoded creds don't scale across tenants and are a security risk. | **MUST fetch from Secrets Manager per tenant** |
