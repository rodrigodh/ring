# Dev Frontend Accessibility Testing (Gate 2)

## Overview

Ensure all frontend components meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility standards through automated axe-core scanning, keyboard navigation testing, and focus management validation.

**Core principle:** Accessibility is not optional. All components MUST be accessible to all users, including those using keyboard navigation, screen readers, and assistive technologies.

<block_condition>
- Any WCAG AA violation = FAIL
- Missing keyboard navigation tests = FAIL
- Missing focus management for modals = FAIL
</block_condition>

## CRITICAL: Role Clarification

**This skill ORCHESTRATES. Frontend QA Analyst Agent (accessibility mode) EXECUTES.**

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **This Skill** | Gather requirements, dispatch agent, track iterations |
| **QA Analyst Frontend Agent** | Run axe-core, write keyboard tests, verify ARIA |

---

## Standards Reference

**MANDATORY:** Load testing-accessibility.md standards via WebFetch.

<fetch_required>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V4-Company/marsai/main/dev-team/docs/standards/frontend/testing-accessibility.md
</fetch_required>

---

## Step 1: Validate Input

```text
REQUIRED INPUT:
- unit_id: [task/subtask being tested]
- implementation_files: [files from Gate 0]
- language: [typescript only]

OPTIONAL INPUT:
- gate1_handoff: [full Gate 1 output]

if any REQUIRED input is missing:
  → STOP and report: "Missing required input: [field]"

if language != "typescript":
  → STOP and report: "Frontend accessibility testing only supported for TypeScript/React"
```

## Step 2: Dispatch Frontend QA Analyst Agent (Accessibility Mode)

```text
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "marsai:qa-analyst-frontend"
  prompt: |
    **MODE:** ACCESSIBILITY TESTING (Gate 2)

    **Standards:** Load testing-accessibility.md

    **Input:**
    - Unit ID: {unit_id}
    - Implementation Files: {implementation_files}
    - Language: typescript

    **Requirements:**
    1. Run axe-core scans on all components (all states: default, loading, error, empty, disabled)
    2. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)
    3. Test focus management (trap, restoration, auto-focus)
    4. Verify semantic HTML usage
    5. Check ARIA attributes
    6. Verify color contrast

    **Output Sections Required:**
    - ## Accessibility Testing Summary
    - ## Violations Report
    - ## Handoff to Next Gate
```

## Step 3: Evaluate Results

```text
Parse agent output:

if "Status: PASS" in output:
  → Gate 2 PASSED
  → Return success with metrics

if "Status: FAIL" in output:
  → Dispatch fix to implementation agent (marsai:frontend-engineer or marsai:ui-engineer)
  → Re-run accessibility tests (max 3 iterations)
  → If still failing: ESCALATE to user
```

## Step 4: Generate Output

```text
## Accessibility Testing Summary
**Status:** {PASS|FAIL}
**Components Tested:** {count}
**Violations Found:** {count}
**Keyboard Nav Tests:** {count}
**Focus Management Tests:** {count}

## Violations Report
| Component | States Scanned | Violations | Status |
|-----------|---------------|------------|--------|
| {component} | {states} | {count} | {PASS|FAIL} |

## Handoff to Next Gate
- Ready for Gate 3 (Unit Testing): {YES|NO}
- Iterations: {count}
```

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Legal compliance risk, users blocked | Missing alt text on images, no keyboard access, form without labels |
| **HIGH** | WCAG AA violation, significant barrier | Color contrast fails, missing focus indicators, no skip links |
| **MEDIUM** | Minor accessibility gaps | Non-semantic HTML, missing ARIA on complex widgets |
| **LOW** | Best practices, enhancements | Optional ARIA improvements, landmark suggestions |

Report all severities. CRITICAL = immediate fix (legal risk). HIGH = fix before gate pass. MEDIUM = fix in iteration. LOW = document.

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations. Gate-specific:

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "It's an internal tool" | WCAG compliance is mandatory for all applications. | **Run accessibility tests** |
| "The library handles it" | Components can be misused. axe-core catches misuse. | **Run axe-core scans** |
| "We'll fix accessibility later" | Retrofitting costs 10x. Fix now. | **Fix violations now** |
| "Only one violation, it's minor" | One violation = FAIL. No exceptions. | **Fix all violations** |
| "Keyboard nav works, I tested manually" | Manual ≠ automated. Tests must be repeatable. | **Write automated tests** |
