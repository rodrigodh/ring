# Standards Coverage Table Pattern

This file defines the MANDATORY output format for agents comparing codebases against Ring standards. It ensures every section in the standards is explicitly checked and reported.

---

## ⛔ CRITICAL: All Sections Are Required

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every section listed in the Agent → Standards Section Index below MUST be checked.**

| Rule                                          | Enforcement                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Every section MUST be checked**             | No exceptions. No skipping.                                                         |
| **Every section MUST appear in output table** | Missing row = INCOMPLETE output                                                     |
| **Subsections are INCLUDED**                  | If "Containers" is listed, all content (Dockerfile, Docker Compose) MUST be checked |
| **N/A requires explicit reason**              | Cannot mark N/A without justification                                               |

**If you skip any section → Your output is REJECTED. Start over.**

**If you invent section names → Your output is REJECTED. Start over.**

---

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Section Names Are Not Negotiable

**You MUST use the EXACT section names from this file. You CANNOT:**

| FORBIDDEN         | Example                                     | Why Wrong              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Invent names      | "Security", "Code Quality"                  | Not in coverage table  |
| Rename sections   | "Config" instead of "Configuration Loading" | Breaks traceability    |
| Merge sections    | "Error Handling & Logging"                  | Each section = one row |
| Use abbreviations | "Bootstrap" instead of "Bootstrap Pattern"  | Must match exactly     |
| Skip sections     | Omitting "RabbitMQ Worker Pattern"          | Mark N/A instead       |

**Your output table section names MUST match the "Section to Check" column below EXACTLY.**

---

## Why This Pattern Exists

**Problem:** Agents might skip sections from standards files, either by:

- Only checking "main" sections
- Assuming some sections don't apply
- Not enumerating all sections systematically
- Skipping subsections (e.g., checking Dockerfile but skipping Docker Compose)

**Solution:** Require a completeness table that MUST list every section from the WebFetch result with explicit status. All content within each section MUST be evaluated.

---

## MANDATORY: Standards Coverage Table

### ⛔ HARD GATE: Before Outputting Findings

**You MUST output a Standards Coverage Table that enumerates every section from the WebFetch result.**

**REQUIRED: When checking a section, you MUST check all subsections and patterns within it.**

| Section                | What MUST Be Checked                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Containers             | Dockerfile patterns and Docker Compose patterns                 |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform structure and state management and modules            |
| Observability          | Logging and Tracing (structured JSON logs, OpenTelemetry spans) |
| Security               | Secrets management and Network policies                         |

### Process

1. **Parse the WebFetch result** - Extract all `## Section` headers from the standards file
2. **Count sections** - Record total number of sections found
3. **For each section** - Determine status and evidence
4. **Output table** - MUST have one row per section
5. **Verify completeness** - Table row count MUST equal section count

### Output Format

```markdown
## Standards Coverage Table

**Standards File:** {filename}.md (from WebFetch)
**Total Sections Found:** {N}
**Table Rows:** {N} (MUST match)

| #   | Section (from WebFetch) | Status       | Evidence            |
| --- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| 1   | {Section 1 header}      | ✅/⚠️/❌/N/A | file:line or reason |
| 2   | {Section 2 header}      | ✅/⚠️/❌/N/A | file:line or reason |
| ... | ...                     | ...          | ...                 |
| N   | {Section N header}      | ✅/⚠️/❌/N/A | file:line or reason |

**Completeness Verification:**

- Sections in standards: {N}
- Rows in table: {N}
- Status: ✅ Complete / ❌ Incomplete
```

### Status Legend

| Status           | Meaning                            | When to Use                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Compliant     | Codebase follows this standard     | Code matches expected pattern        |
| ⚠️ Partial       | Some compliance, needs improvement | Partially implemented or minor gaps  |
| ❌ Non-Compliant | Does not follow standard           | Missing or incorrect implementation  |
| N/A              | Not applicable to this codebase    | Standard doesn't apply (with reason) |

---

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Standards Boundary Enforcement

**You MUST check only what the standards file explicitly defines. Never invent requirements.**

See [shared-patterns/standards-boundary-enforcement.md](standards-boundary-enforcement.md) for:

- Complete list of what IS and IS not required per agent
- Agent-specific requirement boundaries
- Self-verification checklist

**⛔ HARD GATE:** Before flagging any item as non-compliant:

1. Verify the requirement EXISTS in the WebFetch result
2. Quote the EXACT standard that requires it
3. If you cannot quote it → Do not flag it

---

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization                                | Why It's WRONG                                                      | Required Action                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| "I checked the important sections"             | You don't decide importance. All sections MUST be checked.          | **List every section in table**                   |
| "Some sections obviously don't apply"          | Report them as N/A with reason. Never skip silently.                | **Include in table with N/A status**              |
| "The table would be too long"                  | Completeness > brevity. Every section MUST be visible.              | **Output full table regardless of length**        |
| "I already mentioned these in findings"        | Findings ≠ Coverage table. Both are REQUIRED.                       | **Output table BEFORE detailed findings**         |
| "WebFetch result was unclear"                  | Parse all `## ` headers. If truly unclear, STOP and report blocker. | **Report blocker or parse all headers**           |
| "I checked Dockerfile, that covers Containers" | Containers = Dockerfile + Docker Compose. Partial ≠ Complete.       | **Check all subsections within each section**     |
| "Project doesn't use Docker Compose"           | Report as N/A with evidence. Never assume. VERIFY first.            | **Search for docker-compose.yml, report finding** |
| "Only checking what exists in codebase"        | Standards define what SHOULD exist. Missing = Non-Compliant.        | **Report missing patterns as ❌ Non-Compliant**   |
| "My section name is clearer"                   | Consistency > clarity. Coverage table names are the contract.       | **Use EXACT names from coverage table**           |
| "I combined related sections for brevity"      | Each section = one row. Merging loses traceability.                 | **One row per section, no merging**               |
| "I added a useful section like 'Security'"     | You don't decide sections. Coverage table does.                     | **Only output sections from coverage table**      |
| "'Logging' is the same as 'Logging Standards'" | Names must match EXACTLY. Variations break automation.              | **Use exact string from coverage table**          |

---

## Completeness Check (SELF-VERIFICATION)

**Before submitting output, verify:**

```text
1. Did I extract all ## headers from WebFetch result?     [ ]
2. Does my table have exactly that many rows?             [ ]
3. Does every row have a status (✅/⚠️/❌/N/A)?           [ ]
4. Does every ⚠️/❌ have evidence (file:line)?           [ ]
5. Does every N/A have a reason?                         [ ]

If any checkbox is unchecked → FIX before submitting.
```

---

## Integration with Findings

**Order of output:**

1. **Standards Coverage Table** (this pattern) - Shows completeness
2. **Detailed Findings** - Only for ⚠️ Partial and ❌ Non-Compliant items

The Coverage Table ensures nothing is skipped. The Detailed Findings provide actionable information for gaps.

## How Agents Reference This Pattern

Agents MUST include this in their Standards Compliance section:

```markdown
## Standards Compliance Output (Conditional)

**Detection:** Prompt contains `**MODE: ANALYSIS only**`

**When triggered, you MUST:**

1. Output Standards Coverage Table per [shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md](../skills/shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md)
2. Then output detailed findings for ⚠️/❌ items

See [shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md](../skills/shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md) for:

- Table format
- Status legend
- Anti-rationalization rules
- Completeness verification checklist
```

---

## Agent → Standards Section Index

**IMPORTANT:** When updating a standards file, you MUST also update the corresponding section index below.

**Meta-sections (EXCLUDED from agent checks):**
Standards files may contain these meta-sections that are not counted in section indexes:

- `## Checklist` - Self-verification checklist for developers
- `## Standards Compliance` - Output format examples for agents
- `## Standards Compliance Output Format` - Output templates

These sections describe HOW to use the standards, not WHAT the standards are.

## Maintenance Instructions

**When you add/modify a section in a standards file:**

1. Edit `dev-team/docs/standards/{file}.md` - Add your new `## Section Name`
2. Edit THIS file - Add the section to the corresponding agent table above
3. Verify row count matches section count

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Rationalization                   | Why It's WRONG                                     | Required Action                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| "I'll update the index later"     | Later = never. Sync drift causes missed checks.    | **Update BOTH files in same commit** |
| "The section is minor"            | Minor ≠ optional. All sections must be indexed.    | **Add to index regardless of size**  |
| "Agents parse dynamically anyway" | Index is the explicit contract. Dynamic is backup. | **Index is source of truth**         |
