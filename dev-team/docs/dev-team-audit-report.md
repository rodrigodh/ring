## Gap Analysis

### HIGH Severity Gaps (3)

#### GAP-H001: ring:frontend-designer - Missing Explicit "When Not Needed" Section
- **File:** `dev-team/agents/frontend-designer.md`
- **Issue:** The agent lacks an explicit "## When Implementation is Not Needed" section
- **Impact:** May not clearly communicate when the agent should NOT be dispatched
- **Fix:** Add section with bullet points like "When implementing existing design specs" or "When using sindarian-ui components without customization"

#### GAP-H002: ring:prompt-quality-reviewer - Missing Explicit "When Not Needed" Section
- **File:** `dev-team/agents/prompt-quality-reviewer.md`
- **Issue:** Missing "## When This Agent is Not Needed" section
- **Impact:** Unclear when to skip this analyst agent
- **Fix:** Add section specifying "When prompt is simple one-liner" or "When no anti-rationalization needed"

#### GAP-H003: ring:using-dev-team - Relies Heavily on Shared-Patterns References
- **File:** `dev-team/skills/using-dev-team/SKILL.md`
- **Issue:** Multiple critical sections reference shared-patterns instead of inline definitions
- **Impact:** Requires loading additional files to understand full requirements
- **Fix:** Consider adding inline summaries with "See [shared-patterns/...] for details" pattern

### MEDIUM Severity Gaps (8)

#### GAP-M001: ring:ui-engineer - Severity Calibration Inline
- **File:** `dev-team/agents/ui-engineer.md`
- **Issue:** Severity calibration is embedded in other sections, not a dedicated table
- **Fix:** Add explicit `## Severity Calibration` section with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW table

#### GAP-M002: ring:dev-property-testing - Shorter Content Than Peers
- **File:** `dev-team/skills/dev-property-testing/SKILL.md`
- **Issue:** Significantly shorter than other gate skills (~150 lines vs ~300+ lines)
- **Fix:** Expand with more detailed examples, edge cases, and verification steps

#### GAP-M003: ring:dev-feedback-loop - Missing Explicit Severity Calibration
- **File:** `dev-team/skills/dev-feedback-loop/SKILL.md`
- **Issue:** No severity calibration table for findings
- **Fix:** Add severity levels for different types of feedback findings

#### GAP-M004: ring:dev-frontend-visual - Incomplete Skip Conditions
- **File:** `dev-team/skills/dev-frontend-visual/SKILL.md`
- **Issue:** Uses `skip_when` in frontmatter but content says "Snapshots are brittle" as NOT_skip
- **Fix:** Clarify the skip_when vs NOT_skip_when distinction in frontmatter

#### GAP-M005: ring:sre - Validation Focus Could Be Clearer
- **File:** `dev-team/agents/sre.md`
- **Issue:** Role as "validator not implementer" could be more prominently stated
- **Fix:** Add more prominent role clarification at the top

#### GAP-M006: Standards Loading URLs - 2 Skills Missing
- **Files:** `ring:dev-feedback-loop`, `ring:using-dev-team`
- **Issue:** No explicit WebFetch URLs in fetch_required tags
- **Fix:** Add `<fetch_required>` blocks with explicit URLs

#### GAP-M007: ring:dev-validation - Self-Approval Prohibition Needs More Examples
- **File:** `dev-team/skills/dev-validation/SKILL.md`
- **Issue:** Self-approval prohibition section could benefit from more edge case examples
- **Fix:** Add more "role switching" scenarios as prohibited

#### GAP-M008: Shared-Patterns Dependency
- **Files:** Multiple skills
- **Issue:** Heavy reliance on shared-patterns directory for anti-rationalization tables
- **Impact:** Skills are less self-contained
- **Fix:** Consider inline summaries with full reference links

### LOW Severity Gaps (12)

| GAP ID | File | Issue | Fix |
|--------|------|-------|-----|
| GAP-L001 | backend-engineer-golang | 47 sections is very long | Consider splitting into core vs extended |
| GAP-L002 | backend-engineer-typescript | Could use more examples | Add 2-3 more code examples per section |
| GAP-L003 | devops-engineer | Missing cloud-specific guidance | Add AWS/GCP/Azure patterns |
| GAP-L004 | frontend-bff-engineer-typescript | Dual-mode complexity | Add decision tree for mode selection |
| GAP-L005 | frontend-engineer | sindarian-ui priority could be clearer | Add visual decision flowchart |
| GAP-L006 | qa-analyst | Chaos testing section brief | Expand Toxiproxy examples |
| GAP-L007 | qa-analyst-frontend | New (v1.0.0) - may need iteration | Monitor for gaps in practice |
| GAP-L008 | dev-chaos-testing | Toxiproxy setup could be more detailed | Add docker-compose example |
| GAP-L009 | dev-cycle | 10-gate complexity | Add visual gate flow diagram |
| GAP-L010 | dev-cycle-frontend | 9-gate mirrors backend closely | Document key differences prominently |
| GAP-L011 | dev-multi-tenant | Very detailed (good) but long | Add TL;DR summary at top |
| GAP-L012 | dev-refactor | Long skill file | Consider splitting into sub-skills |

## Compliance with CLAUDE.md Lexical Salience Guidelines

### Enforcement Word Positioning

| Requirement | Compliance | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Enforcement words at BEGINNING of instructions | ✅ 95% compliant | Minor exceptions in prose sections |
| MUST/CANNOT/FORBIDDEN/STOP leading sentences | ✅ Excellent | Consistent pattern across all files |
| Strategic spacing between critical sections | ✅ Good | Uses markdown headers and blank lines |
| Semantic block tags | ✅ Excellent | Uses `<cannot_skip>`, `<block_condition>`, `<dispatch_required>` |

### XML-Like Tag Usage

| Tag | Files Using | Correct Usage |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| `<cannot_skip>` | 25/30 | ✅ Used for non-negotiable requirements |
| `<block_condition>` | 22/30 | ✅ Used for STOP conditions |
| `<dispatch_required>` | 18/19 skills | ✅ Used for agent dispatch instructions |
| `<forbidden>` | 20/30 | ✅ Used for prohibited actions |
| `<fetch_required>` | 17/19 skills | ⚠️ 2 skills missing explicit URLs |
| `<verify_before_proceed>` | 15/19 skills | ✅ Used for input validation |
| `<user_decision>` | 3/30 | ✅ Used for approval gates |

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Address HIGH Severity Gaps (Week 1)

1. **Add "When Not Needed" sections** to `ring:frontend-designer` and `ring:prompt-quality-reviewer`
2. **Add inline summaries** to `ring:using-dev-team` for critical sections that reference shared-patterns

### Priority 2: Address MEDIUM Severity Gaps (Week 2)

1. **Add Severity Calibration tables** to skills missing them
2. **Expand `ring:dev-property-testing`** to match peer skill depth
3. **Add `<fetch_required>` blocks** to skills missing them

### Priority 3: Address LOW Severity Gaps (Ongoing)

1. Add visual diagrams to complex orchestrator skills
2. Expand examples in shorter sections
3. Consider skill splitting for very long files (>500 lines)

---

## Strengths Identified

### Excellent Patterns to Preserve

1. **Anti-Rationalization Tables**: Every agent and skill has comprehensive tables preventing AI rationalization
2. **Shared-Patterns Directory**: Effective reuse of common patterns across skills
3. **Role Clarification**: Clear "This skill ORCHESTRATES. Agents EXECUTE." patterns
4. **Strong Language**: Consistent use of MUST, CANNOT, FORBIDDEN, STOP
5. **Input/Output Schemas**: Well-defined YAML schemas in frontmatter
6. **Verification Commands**: Automated verification commands in most skills
7. **Pressure Resistance Tables**: Comprehensive handling of user pressure scenarios
8. **Block Conditions**: Clear STOP conditions with `<block_condition>` tags

### Best-in-Class Files

| File | Why It's Exemplary |
|------|-------------------|
| ring:backend-engineer-golang | Most comprehensive standards coverage (47 sections) |
| ring:dev-cycle | Excellent orchestrator pattern with state persistence |
| ring:dev-multi-tenant | Detailed gate-by-gate implementation guide |
| ring:dev-refactor | Strong mandatory gap principle enforcement |
| ring:qa-analyst | Clear 5-mode operation with distinct standards per mode |

## Conclusion

The ring-dev-team plugin demonstrates **excellent compliance** with CLAUDE.md standards. The 3 HIGH severity gaps and 8 MEDIUM severity gaps are minor documentation improvements that can be addressed incrementally. The plugin's architecture—with shared-patterns for reusable content, clear orchestrator-executor separation, and comprehensive anti-rationalization tables—serves as a model for other Ring plugins.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Address HIGH severity gaps within 1 week
2. Address MEDIUM severity gaps within 2 weeks
3. Track LOW severity gaps in backlog for incremental improvement
