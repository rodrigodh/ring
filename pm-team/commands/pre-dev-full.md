name: ring:pre-dev-full
description: Complete 10-gate pre-dev workflow for large features (≥2 days)
argument-hint: "[feature-name]"
---

I'm running the **Full Track** pre-development workflow (10 gates) for your feature.

**This track is for features that have ANY of:**
- ❌ Take ≥2 days to implement
- ❌ Add new external dependencies (APIs, databases, libraries)
- ❌ Create new data models or entities
- ❌ Require multi-service integration
- ❌ Use new architecture patterns
- ❌ Require team collaboration

**If feature is simple (<2 days, existing patterns), use `/ring:pre-dev-feature` instead.**

## Document Organization

All artifacts will be saved to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/`

**First, let me ask you about your feature:**

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather:

**Question 1:** "What is the name of your feature?"
- Header: "Feature Name"
- This will be used for the directory name
- Use kebab-case (e.g., "auth-system", "payment-processing", "file-upload")

---

### Topology Discovery (MANDATORY)

**After getting the feature name, determine the project topology.**

See [shared-patterns/topology-discovery.md](../skills/shared-patterns/topology-discovery.md) for full pattern.

**Question 1.1:** "What is the scope of this feature?"
- Header: "Scope"
- Options:
  - "Fullstack (Recommended)" - Both backend API and frontend UI components
  - "Backend only" - API endpoints, services, data layer, no UI
  - "Frontend only" - UI components, pages, BFF routes, no backend API
- **Processing:**
  - If "Backend only" or "Frontend only" → Skip Q1.2-Q1.4, set `structure: single-repo`
  - If "Fullstack" → Continue to Q1.2

**Question 1.2 (if scope=fullstack):** "How is the codebase organized?"
- Header: "Structure"
- Options:
  - "Single repo (Recommended)" - All code in one repository, same root directory
  - "Monorepo" - Multiple packages in one repo (e.g., packages/api, packages/web)
  - "Multi-repo" - Separate repositories for backend and frontend
- **Processing:**
  - If "Single repo" → Skip Q1.3, continue to Q1.4
  - If "Monorepo" or "Multi-repo" → Continue to Q1.3

**Question 1.3 (if structure=monorepo or multi-repo):** Module paths
- For monorepo: Ask "Backend package path?" and "Frontend package path?"
  - Examples: `packages/api`, `apps/backend`, `services/api`
- For multi-repo: Ask "Backend repo path?" and "Frontend repo path?"
  - Use absolute paths: `/home/user/projects/backend-api`
- **Auto-detection hints:**
  - Run `ls packages/ apps/ libs/ 2>/dev/null` to suggest common monorepo paths
  - Check for `go.mod` or `package.json` in subdirectories

**Question 1.4 (if scope=fullstack):** "How should pre-dev docs be organized?"
- Header: "Docs"
- Options:
  - "Unified (Recommended)" - Single tasks.md with module tags - easier to track
  - "Per-module" - Separate task files per module (backend/, frontend/)

**TopologyConfig Output:**

After topology discovery, construct and display the configuration:

```yaml
Topology Configuration:
  scope: fullstack | backend-only | frontend-only
  structure: single-repo | monorepo | multi-repo
  modules:  # (only if monorepo or multi-repo)
    backend:
      path: [user input]
      language: [auto-detected]
    frontend:
      path: [user input]
      framework: [auto-detected]
  doc_organization: unified | per-module
  doc_placement: unified | per-module | distributed  # NEW: derived from structure
  api_pattern: bff | none  # bff if dynamic data, none if static frontend
```

**This TopologyConfig is passed to all gates and persisted in research.md frontmatter.**

---

**Question 2 (CONDITIONAL):** "Does this feature require authentication or authorization?"
- **Auto-detection:** Before asking, check if `go.mod` contains `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-auth`
  - If **found** → Skip this question. Auth is already integrated at project level.
  - If **not found** → Ask this question (new project or project without auth)
- Header: "Auth Requirements"
- Options:
  - "None" - No authentication needed
  - "User authentication only" - Users must log in but no permission checks
  - "User + permissions" - Full user auth with role-based access control
  - "Service-to-service auth" - Machine-to-machine authentication only
  - "Full (user + service-to-service)" - Both user and service auth
- **Note:** For Go services requiring auth, reference `golang.md` → Access Manager Integration section during TRD creation (Gate 3) and Dependency Map (Gate 6)

**Question 3 (CONDITIONAL):** "Is this a licensed product/plugin?"
- **Auto-detection:** Before asking, check if `go.mod` contains `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-license-go`
  - If **found** → Skip this question. Licensing is already integrated at project level.
  - If **not found** → Ask this question (new project or project without licensing)
- Header: "License Requirements"
- Options:
  - "No" - Not a licensed product (open source, internal tool, etc.)
  - "Yes" - Licensed product that requires License Manager integration
- **Note:** For Go services requiring license validation, reference `golang.md` → License Manager Integration section during TRD creation (Gate 3) and Dependency Map (Gate 6)

**Why auto-detection?** Access Manager and License Manager are project-level infrastructure decisions, not feature-level. Once integrated, all features in the project inherit them.

**Question 4 (MANDATORY):** "Does this feature include user interface (UI)?"
- Header: "Has UI?"
- Options:
  - "Yes" - Feature includes pages, screens, forms, dashboards, or any visual interface
  - "No" - Backend-only feature (API, service, CLI, etc.)
- **IMPORTANT:** This question MUST always be asked. Do NOT assume based on feature description keywords.
- **Why mandatory?** Keyword detection is unreliable. Explicitly asking prevents skipping UI configuration.

**Question 5 (MANDATORY if Q4=Yes):** "Which UI component library should be used?"
- **Trigger:** Only ask if Q4 = "Yes"
- **Auto-detection:** Before asking, check `package.json` for existing UI libraries:
  - `@radix-ui/*` packages → shadcn/ui detected
  - `@chakra-ui/*` packages → Chakra UI detected
  - `@headlessui/*` packages → Headless UI detected
  - `@mui/*` or `@material-ui/*` → Material UI detected
  - If **library found** → Still ask, but pre-select detected option and display: "Detected: [library] from package.json"
  - If **not found** → Ask without pre-selection
- Header: "UI Library"
- Options:
  - "shadcn/ui + Radix (Recommended)" - TailwindCSS-based, highly customizable, copy-paste components
  - "Chakra UI" - Full component library with built-in theming system
  - "Headless UI" - Minimal unstyled primitives, Tailwind-native
  - "Material UI" - Google's Material Design components
  - "Ant Design" - Enterprise-grade React components
  - "Custom components only" - Build from scratch, no external UI library
- **Usage:** This choice informs wireframes (component names), TRD (dependencies), and implementation tasks
- **CANNOT be skipped:** Even with auto-detection, user must confirm the choice

**Question 6 (MANDATORY if Q4=Yes):** "Which styling approach should be used?"
- **Trigger:** Only ask if Q4 = "Yes"
- **Auto-detection:** Before asking, check `package.json` for existing styling:
  - `tailwindcss` → TailwindCSS detected
  - `styled-components` → Styled Components detected
  - `@emotion/*` → Emotion detected
  - `sass` or `node-sass` → Sass/SCSS detected
  - If **styling found** → Still ask, but pre-select detected option and display: "Detected: [styling] from package.json"
  - If **not found** → Ask without pre-selection
- Header: "Styling"
- Options:
  - "TailwindCSS (Recommended)" - Utility-first CSS, excellent for design systems
  - "CSS Modules" - Scoped CSS files, traditional approach
  - "Styled Components" - CSS-in-JS with tagged template literals
  - "Sass/SCSS" - CSS preprocessor with variables and nesting
  - "Vanilla CSS" - Plain CSS without preprocessors
- **Usage:** This choice informs wireframes (class naming), component implementation, and code review criteria
- **CANNOT be skipped:** Even with auto-detection, user must confirm the choice

**Question 7 (MANDATORY if Q4=Yes AND new project):** "What is the target accessibility level?"
- **Trigger:** Only ask if Q4 = "Yes" AND (no existing `package.json` OR no existing a11y config)
- **Auto-detection:** Check for existing accessibility configuration:
  - `@axe-core/*` in package.json → Skip, note "Detected: accessibility testing configured"
  - `pa11y` in package.json → Skip, note "Detected: accessibility testing configured"
  - `.lighthouserc.*` file exists → Skip, note "Detected: Lighthouse CI configured"
  - If **config found** → Skip question, use detected level
  - If **not found** → Ask question
- Header: "Accessibility"
- Options:
  - "WCAG 2.1 AA (Recommended)" - Standard compliance, 4.5:1 contrast for normal text, 3:1 for large text
  - "WCAG 2.1 AAA" - Enhanced compliance, 7:1 contrast for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text
  - "Basic" - Semantic HTML only, no strict contrast requirements
- **Usage:** Informs contrast validation in design-system.md, component requirements, code review criteria
- **Why this matters:** Accessibility requirements affect color choices, component design, and testing requirements

**Question 8 (MANDATORY if Q4=Yes AND new project):** "Does the application need dark mode support?"
- **Trigger:** Only ask if Q4 = "Yes" AND (no existing `package.json` OR no dark mode detected)
- **Auto-detection:** Check for existing dark mode:
  - `dark:` classes in existing components → Skip, note "Detected: dark mode classes in use"
  - CSS variables with `.dark` class in globals.css → Skip, note "Detected: dark mode CSS variables"
  - Theme provider (next-themes, etc.) in layout → Skip, note "Detected: theme provider configured"
  - If **dark mode found** → Skip question, note existing configuration
  - If **not found** → Ask question
- Header: "Dark Mode"
- Options:
  - "Light + Dark (Recommended)" - Full theme support with system preference detection
  - "Light only" - Single light theme, no dark mode
  - "Dark only" - Single dark theme (for specific apps like developer tools)
- **Usage:** Informs design-system.md color tokens, CSS architecture, component variants
- **Why this matters:** Dark mode requires dual color palettes and affects contrast calculations

**Question 9 (MANDATORY if Q4=Yes AND new project):** "What is the primary brand color?"
- **Trigger:** Only ask if Q4 = "Yes" AND (no existing `package.json` OR no brand colors detected)
- **Auto-detection:** Check for existing brand colors:
  - `tailwind.config.*` with custom `primary` color → Skip, note "Detected: primary color in Tailwind config"
  - CSS variable `--primary` or `--color-primary` in globals.css → Skip, note "Detected: primary color CSS variable"
  - If **brand color found** → Skip question, note existing configuration
  - If **not found** → Ask question
- Header: "Brand Color"
- Options:
  - "Blue" - Professional, trustworthy (finance, enterprise, healthcare)
  - "Purple" - Creative, innovative (tech startups, design tools)
  - "Green" - Growth, sustainability (fintech, eco, wellness)
  - "Orange" - Energy, action (marketplaces, social, food)
  - "Custom (specify hex)" - Custom brand color (user provides hex code)
- **Usage:** Informs design-system.md primary palette, derived colors, semantic mappings
- **Why this matters:** Brand color defines the primary visual identity and derived color palette

**Question 10 (MANDATORY if Q4=Yes AND new project):** "What typography style fits the brand?"
- **Trigger:** Only ask if Q4 = "Yes" AND (no existing `package.json` OR no custom fonts detected)
- **Auto-detection:** Check for existing typography:
  - Font imports in `layout.tsx` or `_app.tsx` → Skip, note "Detected: [font] configured"
  - `@fontsource/*` packages in package.json → Skip, note "Detected: [font] in dependencies"
  - Google Fonts in `next/font/google` imports → Skip, note "Detected: [font] from Google Fonts"
  - If **fonts found** → Skip question, note existing configuration
  - If **not found** → Ask question
- Header: "Typography"
- Options:
  - "Modern Tech (Geist) - Recommended" - Clean, technical feel, excellent for SaaS/developer tools
  - "Contemporary (Satoshi)" - Friendly, approachable, good for consumer apps
  - "Editorial (Cabinet Grotesk)" - Bold, statement-making, good for marketing/media
  - "Professional (General Sans)" - Neutral, enterprise-grade, good for B2B
- **Usage:** Informs design-system.md typography scale, font loading strategy, component styles
- **Why this matters:** Typography affects readability, brand perception, and page load performance
- **Note:** Avoid generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial) per frontend standards

**Question 11 (MANDATORY if scope=fullstack or frontend-only with UI):** "Does this feature require dynamic data?"
- **Trigger:** Only ask if topology scope = "Fullstack" OR "Frontend-only" (from Q1.1)
- Header: "Dynamic Data"
- Options:
  - "Yes - Dynamic data required" - Feature needs API calls, database access, or external services
  - "No - Static frontend only" - Pure static content, no server-side data fetching
- **Processing:**
  - "Yes" → `api_pattern: bff` (MANDATORY - BFF via Next.js API Routes)
  - "No" → `api_pattern: none` (static frontend)
- **Why this matters:** Determines if BFF layer is needed:
  - Dynamic data → BFF routes handle all data fetching (MANDATORY)
  - Static → No API layer needed

## ⛔ HARD RULE: BFF is MANDATORY for Dynamic Data

**Client-side code MUST NEVER call backend APIs, databases, or external services directly.**

| If Feature Has... | Then... |
|-------------------|---------|
| API calls to backend | BFF is MANDATORY |
| Database access | BFF is MANDATORY |
| External service integration | BFF is MANDATORY |
| Only static content | No BFF needed |

**"Direct API calls" is FORBIDDEN.** All dynamic data flows through BFF (Next.js API Routes).

**UI Configuration Summary:** After Q4-Q11, display:
```
UI Configuration:
- Has UI: Yes/No
- UI Library: [choice] (confirmed by user)
- Styling: [choice] (confirmed by user)
- Accessibility: [WCAG AA | WCAG AAA | Basic] (for new projects)
- Dark Mode: [Light + Dark | Light only | Dark only] (for new projects)
- Brand Color: [Blue | Purple | Green | Orange | #hex] (for new projects)
- Typography: [Geist | Satoshi | Cabinet Grotesk | General Sans] (for new projects)
- API Pattern: [bff | none] (bff if dynamic data, none if static)
```

**GATE BLOCKER:** If Q4 = "Yes" but Q5 or Q6 were not answered, DO NOT proceed to Gate 0. Return and ask the missing questions. For new projects with UI, Q7-Q10 are also required. If scope = "Fullstack" or "Frontend-only" with UI, Q11 (Dynamic Data) must be answered.

This configuration is passed to all subsequent gates and used by:
- **Gate 0 (Research):** product-designer searches for patterns in the chosen library
- **Gate 1 (PRD/UX):** criteria reference available components
- **Gate 2 (Feature Map/UX Design):** wireframes use component names from the library
- **Gate 3 (TRD):** architecture considers UI library constraints
- **Gate 6 (Dependency Map):** lists UI library and styling framework as dependencies
- **Gate 7 (Tasks):** implementation tasks reference specific components

After getting the feature name (and auth/license/UI requirements if applicable), create the directory structure and run the 9-gate workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>
```

## Gate 0: Research Phase

**Skill:** ring:pre-dev-research

1. Determine research mode by asking user or inferring from context:
   - **greenfield**: New capability, no existing patterns
   - **modification**: Extending existing functionality
   - **integration**: Connecting external systems

2. Dispatch 4 research agents in PARALLEL:
   - ring:repo-research-analyst (codebase patterns, file:line refs)
   - ring:best-practices-researcher (web search, Context7)

1. Ask user to describe the feature (problem, users, business value)
2. Create PRD document with:
   - Problem statement
   - User stories
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Success metrics
   - Out of scope
3. Save to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/prd.md`
4. Run Gate 1 validation checklist
5. Dispatch product-designer for UX validation (mode: ux-validation)
6. Save to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/ux-criteria.md`
7. Get human approval before proceeding

**Gate 1 Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Problem is clearly defined
- [ ] User value is measurable
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Scope is explicitly bounded
- [ ] UX criteria defined (ux-criteria.md created)

## Gate 2: Feature Map Creation + UX Design

**Skill:** ring:pre-dev-feature-map

1. Load PRD from `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/prd.md`
2. Load ux-criteria.md from `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/ux-criteria.md`
3. Create feature map document with:
   - Feature relationships and dependencies
   - Domain boundaries
   - Integration points
   - Scope visualization
4. Save to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/feature-map.md`
5. Run Gate 2 validation checklist
6. Dispatch product-designer for UX design (mode: ux-design)
7. Save to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/user-flows.md`
8. Save to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/wireframes/` (directory with YAML specs)
9. Get human approval before proceeding

**Gate 2 Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All features from PRD mapped
- [ ] Relationships are clear
- [ ] Domain boundaries defined
- [ ] Feature interactions documented
- [ ] User flows documented (user-flows.md created)
- [ ] Wireframe specs created (wireframes/ directory)

## Gate 2.5: Design Validation (if feature has UI)

**Skill:** ring:pre-dev-design-validation

**Purpose:** Verify UX specifications are complete before investing in technical architecture.

### ⛔ HARD GATE: This Gate CANNOT Be Skipped for UI Features

**If Q4 = "Yes" (feature has UI), this gate is MANDATORY. No exceptions.**

1. **Skip condition:** ONLY if feature has NO UI (Q4 = "No", backend-only)
2. Load and validate all design artifacts:
   - ux-criteria.md
   - wireframes/*.yaml
   - wireframes/user-flows.md (or user-flows.md)
3. Run systematic validation checklist:
   - Section 1: Wireframe Completeness (CRITICAL)
   - Section 2: UI States Coverage (CRITICAL)
   - Section 3: Accessibility Specifications
   - Section 4: Responsive Specifications
   - Section 5: User Flow Completeness
   - Section 6: Content Specifications
4. Save report to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/design-validation.md`
5. Evaluate verdict:
   - **DESIGN VALIDATED:** Proceed to Gate 3
   - **CRITICAL GAPS:** STOP. Return to Gate 2 to fix gaps. CANNOT proceed.
   - **MINOR GAPS:** Ask user - proceed with documented risk or fix first?
6. Get human approval before proceeding

**Gate 2.5 Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All wireframes have ASCII prototypes
- [ ] All screens define loading/error/empty/success states
- [ ] Accessibility criteria specified in ux-criteria.md
- [ ] Responsive behavior documented
- [ ] User flows cover happy path AND error paths
- [ ] Button labels and error messages are specific (not generic)

### ⛔ BLOCKER: Gate 3 (TRD) Will REFUSE to Start Without This

**Gate 3 (TRD) checks for design-validation.md before proceeding.**
- If feature has UI AND design-validation.md is missing → TRD will STOP
- If design-validation.md exists but verdict is not VALIDATED → TRD will STOP

**Why this gate exists:** Incomplete design specs cause 10x implementation rework. Validating now saves time later.

### Anti-Rationalization

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "We're behind schedule, skip validation" | Skipping causes 10x rework. You'll be MORE behind. |
| "Design looks complete to me" | "Looks complete" ≠ validated. Run systematic check. |
| "We can validate later" | TRD depends on complete design. Cannot proceed without. |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions. Every UI feature needs validation. |

## Gate 3: TRD Creation

*Backend repo:* api-design.md, data-model.md, dependency-map.md, tasks.md
*Frontend repo:* ux-criteria.md, user-flows.md, wireframes/, design-validation.md, dependency-map.md, tasks.md

Planning time: 2.5-4.5 hours (comprehensive with UX design)

Next steps:
1. Review artifacts in docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/
2. Use delivery-roadmap.md to communicate timelines to stakeholders
3. Use /ring:worktree to create isolated workspace
4. Use /ring:write-plan to create implementation plan
5. Execute the plan (ui-engineer will use user-flows.md and wireframes/)
```

## Remember

- This is the **Full Track** - comprehensive and thorough (10 gates)
- All gates provide maximum planning depth
- **Gate 0 (Research) runs 4 agents in parallel** for codebase, best practices, framework docs, and UX research
- **Gate 1 creates ux-criteria.md** with UX acceptance criteria
- **Gate 2 creates user-flows.md and wireframes/** with detailed UX design
- **Gate 2.5 (Design Validation) ensures UI specs are complete** before technical work
- Technology decisions happen at Gate 6 (Dependency Map)
- **Gate 9 (Delivery Planning) is MANDATORY** - creates realistic roadmap with timeline
- All documents saved to `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/`
- Get human approval at each gate before proceeding
- Planning investment (2.5-4.5 hours) pays off during implementation
- Delivery roadmap (WHEN/WHO) complements write-plan (HOW)

## MANDATORY: Skills Orchestration

**This command orchestrates multiple skills in a 10-gate workflow.**

### Gate Sequence

| Gate | Skill | Purpose | New Outputs |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | `ring:pre-dev-research` | Domain, technical, and UX research (4 agents) | research.md (includes Product/UX Research) |
| 1 | `ring:pre-dev-prd-creation` | Product requirements + UX validation | prd.md, ux-criteria.md |
| 2 | `ring:pre-dev-feature-map` | Feature scope + UX design | feature-map.md, user-flows.md, wireframes/ |
| 2.5 | `ring:pre-dev-design-validation` | Verify UX specs complete (if UI) | design-validation.md |
| 3 | `ring:pre-dev-trd-creation` | Technical requirements | trd.md |
| 4 | `ring:pre-dev-api-design` | API contracts | api-design.md |
| 5 | `ring:pre-dev-data-model` | Data architecture | data-model.md |
| 6 | `ring:pre-dev-dependency-map` | Technology selection | dependency-map.md |
| 7 | `ring:pre-dev-task-breakdown` | Task decomposition | tasks.md |
| 8 | `ring:pre-dev-subtask-creation` | Implementation steps | subtasks.md |
| 9 | `ring:pre-dev-delivery-planning` | Delivery roadmap |

### Execution Pattern

```
For each gate:
  Use Skill tool: [gate-skill]
  Wait for human approval
  Proceed to next gate
```

Each skill contains its own:
- Anti-rationalization tables
- Gate pass criteria
- Output format requirements

**Do NOT skip gates.** Each gate builds on the previous gate's output.
