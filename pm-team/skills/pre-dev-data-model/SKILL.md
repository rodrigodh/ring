# Data Modeling - Defining Data Structures

## Foundational Principle

**Data structures, relationships, and ownership must be defined before database technology selection.**

Jumping to database-specific schemas without modeling creates:
- Inconsistent data structures across services
- Unclear data ownership and authority
- Schema conflicts discovered during development
- Migration nightmares when requirements change

**The Data Model answers**: WHAT data exists, HOW entities relate, WHO owns what data?
**The Data Model never answers**: WHICH database technology or HOW to implement storage.

## Phase 0: Database Field Naming Strategy (MANDATORY)

**Before defining schemas, determine how to name database fields.**

### Step 1: Check if Gate 4 API standards exist

Check if `docs/pre-dev/{feature-name}/api-standards-ref.md` exists:

```bash
ls docs/pre-dev/{feature-name}/api-standards-ref.md
```

### Step 2: Ask user about database field naming

Use AskUserQuestion tool:

**If api-standards-ref.md EXISTS:**

**Question:** "Gate 4 defined API field names (e.g., `userId`, `createdAt`). How should database fields be named?"
- Header: "DB Field Naming"
- multiSelect: false
- Options:
  1. "Convert to snake_case (Recommended)" (description: "API: userId → DB: user_id (PostgreSQL/MySQL standard)")
  2. "Keep same as API (camelCase)" (description: "API: userId → DB: userId (MongoDB/document DB)")
  3. "Different standards - provide DB dictionary" (description: "I have a separate database naming standards document")
  4. "Define manually for this feature" (description: "No standards, I'll specify field names")

**If api-standards-ref.md DOES NOT EXIST:**

**Question:** "No API standards were defined in Gate 4. How should database fields be named?"
- Header: "DB Field Naming"
- multiSelect: false
- Options:
  1. "Use snake_case (Recommended)" (description: "Standard for PostgreSQL/MySQL: user_id, created_at")
  2. "Use camelCase" (description: "Standard for MongoDB/document DBs: userId, createdAt")
  3. "Load from standards document" (description: "I have a database naming standards document (URL or file)")
  4. "Define manually" (description: "No standards, I'll specify per feature")

### Step 3: Process user selection

#### Option 1 Selected: "Convert to snake_case"

1. Load `api-standards-ref.md` from Gate 4
2. Apply automatic conversion rules:

| API Field (camelCase) | DB Column (snake_case) | Rule |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------|
| userId | user_id | Split on capital letters, join with underscore |
| createdAt | created_at | Split on capital letters, join with underscore |
| isActive | is_active | Preserve boolean prefix |
| phoneNumber | phone_number | Split on capital letters within words |
| userID | user_id | Collapse consecutive capitals |

3. Create `db-standards-ref.md` with converted names + mapping table
4. Document conversion rule: "Automatic camelCase → snake_case conversion"

#### Option 2 Selected: "Keep same as API"

1. Load `api-standards-ref.md` from Gate 4
2. Copy field names without modification
3. Create `db-standards-ref.md` with same names
4. Document strategy: "Database uses same field names as API (camelCase)"

#### Option 3 Selected: "Different standards - provide DB dictionary"

1. Ask for URL or file path (same as Gate 4 Phase 0)
2. Load and extract database-specific standards
3. If conflicts with API standards: create mapping table
4. Document source and differences

**Additionally extract for database context:**

| Database-Specific Element | What to Extract |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Table naming** | Singular vs plural (`user` vs `users`) |
| **Column naming** | snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase |
| **Primary key naming** | `id`, `{table}_id`, `uuid` |
| **Foreign key naming** | `{table}_id`, `{table}_uuid` |
| **Timestamp columns** | `created_at`/`updated_at` vs `createdAt`/`updatedAt` |
| **Boolean prefixes** | `is_`, `has_`, no prefix |
| **Junction table naming** | `user_role` vs `users_roles` vs `user_roles` |

#### Option 4 Selected: "Define manually"

1. Proceed without standards reference
2. Document in `db-standards-ref.md`: "No organizational standards, fields defined per-feature"

### Step 4: Generate db-standards-ref.md

Output to: `docs/pre-dev/{feature-name}/db-standards-ref.md`

**If conversion from API standards (Option 1 or 2):**

```markdown
# Database Standards Reference - {Feature Name}

Source: Converted from api-standards-ref.md (Gate 4)
Conversion: {camelCase → snake_case / same as API}
Generated: {ISO 8601 timestamp}

## Field Naming Convention

**Database pattern:** {snake_case / camelCase}
**Source:** API standards (Gate 4) with automatic conversion

## Standard Fields

| DB Column | API Field | Type | Example |
|-----------|-----------|------|---------|
| user_id | userId | uuid | "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" |
| email | email | varchar(254) | "user@example.com" |
| created_at | createdAt | timestamptz | "2026-01-23T10:30:00Z" |
| is_active | isActive | boolean | true |

## API to Database Mapping

| API Field | DB Column | Type Conversion |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| userId (string) | user_id (uuid) | Parse UUID string → uuid type |
| createdAt (ISO 8601 string) | created_at (timestamptz) | Parse ISO → timestamptz |
| isActive (boolean) | is_active (boolean) | Direct mapping |

## Conversion Rules

- camelCase → snake_case: Insert underscore before capitals, lowercase all
- Consecutive capitals: Treat as acronym (userID → user_id, not user_i_d)
- Boolean prefixes: Preserve (isActive → is_active, hasPermission → has_permission)
```

**If loaded from separate dictionary (Option 3):**

Follow shared-patterns/standards-discovery.md workflow, including database-specific extractions.

## Mandatory Workflow

| Phase | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| **0. Database Field Naming Strategy** | Check if Gate 4 API standards exist; ask user: reuse with conversion (snake_case/camelCase), load separate DB dictionary, or define manually; generate `db-standards-ref.md` with mapping if applicable |
| **1. Data Analysis** | Load approved API Design (Gate 4), TRD (Gate 3), Feature Map (Gate 2), PRD (Gate 1); extract entities from contracts; identify relationships |
| **2. Data Modeling** | Define entities, specify attributes, model relationships, assign ownership, define constraints, plan lifecycle, design access patterns, consider data quality; **apply field naming strategy from Phase 0** |
| **3. Gate 5 Validation** | Verify all checkboxes before proceeding to Dependency Map |

## Explicit Rules

### ✅ DO Include
Entity definitions (conceptual data objects), attributes with types, constraints (required, unique, ranges), relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N), data ownership (authoritative component), primary identifiers, lifecycle rules (soft delete, archival), access patterns, data quality rules, referential integrity

### ❌ NEVER Include
Database products (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis), table/collection names, index definitions, SQL/query language, ORM frameworks (Prisma, TypeORM), storage engines, partitioning/sharding, replication/backup, database-specific types (JSONB, BIGSERIAL)

### Abstraction Rules

| Element | Abstract (✅) | Database-Specific (❌) |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| Entity | "User" | "users table" |
| Attribute | "emailAddress: String (email format)" | "email VARCHAR(255)" |
| Relationship | "User has many Orders" | "foreign key user_id" |
| Identifier | "Unique identifier" | "UUID primary key" |
| Constraint | "Must be unique" | "UNIQUE INDEX" |

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "We know it's PostgreSQL, just use PG types" | Database choice comes later. Model abstractly now. |
| "Table design is data modeling" | Tables are implementation. Entities are concepts. Stay conceptual. |
| "We need indexes for performance" | Indexes are optimization. Model data first, optimize later. |
| "ORMs require specific schemas" | ORMs adapt to models. Don't let tooling drive design. |
| "Foreign keys define relationships" | Relationships exist conceptually. FKs are implementation. |
| "SQL examples help clarity" | Abstract models are clearer. SQL is implementation detail. |
| "NoSQL doesn't need relationships" | All systems have data relationships. Model them regardless of DB type. |
| "This is just ERD" | ERD is visualization tool. Data model is broader (ownership, lifecycle, etc). |
| "We can skip this for simple CRUD" | Even CRUD needs clear entity design. Don't skip. |
| "Microservices mean no relationships" | Services interact via data. Model entities per service. |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself writing any of these in Data Model, **STOP**:

- Database product names (Postgres, MySQL, Mongo, Redis)
- SQL keywords (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, SELECT, JOIN)
- Database-specific types (SERIAL, JSONB, VARCHAR, TEXT)
- Index commands (CREATE INDEX, UNIQUE INDEX)
- ORM code (Prisma schema, TypeORM decorators)
- Storage details (partitioning, sharding, replication)
- Query optimization (EXPLAIN plans, index hints)
- Backup/recovery strategies

**When you catch yourself**: Replace DB detail with abstract concept. "users table" → "User entity"

## Gate 5 Validation Checklist

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| **Entity Completeness** | All entities from PRD/Feature Map modeled; clear consistent names; defined purpose; boundaries align with TRD components |
| **Attribute Specification** | All types specified; required vs optional explicit; constraints documented; defaults where relevant; computed fields identified |
| **Relationship Modeling** | All relationships documented; cardinality specified (1:1, 1:N, M:N); optional vs required clear; referential integrity to be documented; circular deps resolved |
| **Data Ownership** | Each entity owned by exactly one component; read/write permissions documented; cross-component access via APIs only; no shared database anti-pattern |
| **Data Quality** | Validation rules specified; normalization level appropriate; denormalization justified; consistency strategy defined |
| **Lifecycle Management** | Creation rules; update patterns; deletion strategy (hard/soft); archival/retention policies; audit trail needs |
| **Access Patterns** | Primary patterns documented; query needs identified; write patterns documented; consistency requirements specified |
| **Technology Agnostic** | No database products; no SQL/NoSQL specifics; no table/index definitions; implementable in any DB |

**Gate Result:** ✅ PASS (all checked) → Dependency Map | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (remove DB specifics) | ❌ FAIL (incomplete/poor ownership)

| Constraint Completeness | 0-20 | All rules: 20, Common cases: 12, Minimal: 5 |

**Action:** 80+ autonomous generation | 50-79 present options | <50 ask clarifying questions

---

## Document Placement

**data-model.md is a backend document** - it defines entity structures owned by backend services.

| Structure | data-model.md Location |
|-----------|------------------------|
| single-repo | `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/data-model.md` |
| monorepo | `{backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/data-model.md` |
| multi-repo | `{backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/data-model.md` |

**Why backend path?** Data models are:
- Implemented as database schemas by backend engineers
- Define entities owned by backend components
- Versioned with backend database migrations

**Directory creation for multi-module:**
```bash
# Read topology from research.md frontmatter
backend_path="${topology_modules_backend_path:-"."}"
mkdir -p "${backend_path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}"
```

---

## After Approval

1. ✅ Lock data model - entity structure is now reference
2. 🎯 Use model as input for Dependency Map (`ring:pre-dev-dependency-map`)
3. 🚫 Never add database specifics retroactively
4. 📋 Keep technology-agnostic until Dependency Map

## The Bottom Line

**If you wrote SQL schemas or ORM code, delete it and model abstractly.**

Data modeling is conceptual. Period. No database products. No SQL. No ORMs.

Database technology goes in Dependency Map. That's the next phase. Wait for it.

**Model the data. Stay abstract. Choose database later.**

---

## Standards Loading (MANDATORY)

This skill is a data modeling skill and does NOT require WebFetch of language-specific standards.

**Purpose:** Data Model defines WHAT data exists at a conceptual level. Database-specific patterns and ORM standards are irrelevant at this stage—they apply during Dependency Map (Gate 6) and implementation.

**However**, MUST load API Design (Gate 4) and TRD (Gate 3) artifacts to ensure data model aligns with component boundaries and API contracts.

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

| Condition | Action | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| API Design (Gate 4) not validated | STOP and complete Gate 4 first | CRITICAL |
| Database-specific syntax in model | STOP and abstract to conceptual entities | HIGH |
| Entity ownership unclear (multiple owners) | STOP and define single owner per entity | HIGH |
| Data Model conflicts with API contracts | STOP and reconcile with Gate 4 API Design | HIGH |
| Relationship cardinality ambiguous | STOP and specify 1:1, 1:N, or M:N | MEDIUM |
| db-standards-ref.md cannot be created | STOP and resolve field naming strategy | MEDIUM |

---

## Cannot Be Overridden

These requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:

- MUST NOT include database product names (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- MUST NOT include SQL syntax or ORM decorators
- MUST NOT include table names or index definitions
- MUST define entity ownership (exactly one component per entity)
- MUST specify relationship cardinality for all relationships
- MUST complete Phase 0 (DB Field Naming Strategy) before modeling
- CANNOT proceed to Gate 6 with database-specific content

---

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Cannot proceed with data modeling | Gate 4 not validated, no API contracts to reference |
| **HIGH** | Model contains forbidden content | SQL syntax, table definitions, ORM code |
| **MEDIUM** | Model incomplete | Missing ownership for some entities |
| **LOW** | Minor quality issues | Inconsistent naming conventions |

---

## Pressure Resistance

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "We know it's PostgreSQL, just use PG types" | "Cannot use database-specific types. Model abstractly now. PostgreSQL selection happens in Gate 6." |
| "Add the CREATE TABLE statements" | "Cannot include SQL. Tables are implementation. Define entities conceptually, implement later." |
| "Include the foreign key constraints" | "Cannot include FK syntax. Model relationships as 'User has many Orders'. FK is implementation." |
| "Skip Phase 0, naming is obvious" | "Cannot skip field naming strategy. Mismatch between API and DB names causes bugs. Define strategy now." |
| "ORMs require specific schemas" | "Cannot include ORM code. ORMs adapt to models, not vice versa. Model first, ORM later." |

---

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "We know it's PostgreSQL, just use PG types" | Database choice comes later. Model abstractly now | **Use abstract types (String, Integer, Timestamp)** |
| "Table design IS data modeling" | Tables are implementation. Entities are concepts | **Model entities, not tables** |
| "We need indexes for performance" | Indexes are optimization. Model data first | **Skip indexes, add in implementation** |
| "ORMs require specific schemas" | ORMs adapt to models. Don't let tooling drive design | **Keep model ORM-agnostic** |
| "Foreign keys define relationships" | Relationships exist conceptually. FKs are implementation | **Model relationships, not FKs** |
| "NoSQL doesn't need relationships" | All systems have data relationships. Model regardless | **Model all entity relationships** |

---

## When This Skill Is Not Needed

- Small Track workflow (skip to Task Breakdown)
- No persistent data in feature (skip to Dependency Map)
- API Design (Gate 4) not validated (complete Gate 4 first)
- Data Model already exists and is validated
- Pure API changes with no data impact
- UI-only features with no backend data changes
