# 💍 The Ring - Skills Library for AI Agents

**Proven engineering practices, enforced through skills.**

Ring is a comprehensive skills library and workflow system for AI agents that transforms how AI assistants approach software development. Currently implemented as a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** with **6 active plugins** and **89 skills** (see `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for current versions), the skills themselves are agent-agnostic and can be used with any AI agent system. Ring provides battle-tested patterns, mandatory workflows, and systematic approaches across the entire software delivery value chain.

## ✨ Why Ring?

Without Ring, AI assistants often:

- Skip tests and jump straight to implementation
- Make changes without understanding root causes
- Claim tasks are complete without verification
- Forget to check for existing solutions
- Repeat known mistakes

Ring solves this by:

- **Enforcing proven workflows** - Test-driven development, systematic debugging, proper planning
- **Providing 89 specialized skills** (22 core + 29 dev-team + 15 product planning + 7 FinOps regulatory + 7 technical writing + 9 PMO)
- **38 specialized agents** - 10 review/planning + 12 developer + 4 product research + 3 FinOps regulatory + 3 technical writing + 6 PMO
- **Automating skill discovery** - Skills load automatically at session start
- **Preventing common failures** - Built-in anti-patterns and mandatory checklists

### First Session

When you start a new Claude Code session with Ring installed, you'll see:

```
## Available Skills:
- ring:using-ring (Check for skills BEFORE any task)
- ring:test-driven-development (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)
- ring:systematic-debugging (4-phase root cause analysis)
- ring:verification-before-completion (Evidence before claims)
... and 85 more skills
```

## 🎯 Core Skills

### The Big Four (Use These First!)

#### 1. **ring:using-ring** - Mandatory Skill Discovery

```
Before ANY action → Check skills
Before ANY tool → Check skills
Before ANY code → Check skills
```

#### 2. **ring:test-driven-development** - Test First, Always

```
RED → Write failing test → Watch it fail
GREEN → Minimal code → Watch it pass
REFACTOR → Clean up → Stay green
```

#### 3. **ring:systematic-debugging** - Find Root Cause

```
Phase 1: Investigate (gather ALL evidence)
Phase 2: Analyze patterns
Phase 3: Test hypothesis (one at a time)
Phase 4: Implement fix (with test)
```

#### 4. **ring:verification-before-completion** - Prove It Works

```
Run command → Paste output → Then claim
No "should work" → Only "does work" with proof
```

### Adding a New Skill

**For core Ring skills:**

1. **Create the skill directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir default/skills/your-skill-name
   ```

2. **Write SKILL.md with frontmatter**

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-skill-name
   description: |
     Brief description of WHAT this skill does (the method/technique).
     1-2 sentences maximum.

   trigger: |
     - Specific condition that mandates using this skill
     - Another trigger condition
     - Use quantifiable criteria when possible

   skip_when: |
     - When NOT to use this skill → alternative
     - Another exclusion condition

   sequence:
     after: [prerequisite-skill] # Skills that should come before
     before: [following-skill] # Skills that typically follow

   related:
     similar: [skill-that-seems-similar] # Differentiate from these
     complementary: [skill-that-pairs-well] # Use together with these
   ---
   # Skill content here...
   ```

   **Schema fields explained:**

   - `name`: Skill identifier (matches directory name)
   - `description`: WHAT the skill does (method/technique)
   - `trigger`: WHEN to use - specific, quantifiable conditions
   - `skip_when`: WHEN NOT to use - differentiates from similar skills
   - `sequence`: Workflow ordering (optional)
   - `related`: Similar/complementary skills for disambiguation (optional)

3. **Update documentation**

   - Skills auto-load via `default/hooks/generate-skills-ref.py`
   - Test with session start hook

4. **Submit PR**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-skill-name
   git add default/skills/your-skill-name
   git commit -m "feat(skills): add your-skill-name for X"
   gh pr create
   ```

**For product/team-specific skills:**

1. **Create plugin structure**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p product-xyz/{skills,agents,commands,hooks,lib}
   ```

2. **Register in marketplace**
   Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "ring-product-xyz",
     "description": "Product XYZ specific skills",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "source": "./product-xyz",
     "homepage": "https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring/tree/product-xyz"
   }
   ```

3. **Follow core plugin structure**
   - Use same layout as `default/`
   - Create `product-xyz/hooks/hooks.json` for initialization
   - Add skills to `product-xyz/skills/`

### Skill Quality Standards

- **Mandatory sections**: When to use, How to use, Anti-patterns
- **Include checklists**: TodoWrite-compatible task lists
- **Evidence-based**: Require verification before claims
- **Battle-tested**: Based on real-world experience
- **Clear triggers**: Unambiguous "when to use" conditions

## 📖 Documentation

- **Skills Quick Reference** - Auto-generated at session start from skill frontmatter
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Repository guide for Claude Code
- [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md) - Quick reference for all commands, agents, and workflows
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Architecture diagrams and component relationships
- [Installer](installer/) - Multi-platform installation and migration

## 🎯 Philosophy

Ring embodies these principles:

1. **Skills are mandatory, not optional** - If a skill applies, it MUST be used
2. **Evidence over assumptions** - Prove it works, don't assume
3. **Process prevents problems** - Following workflows prevents known failures
4. **Small steps, verified often** - Incremental progress with continuous validation
5. **Learn from failure** - Anti-patterns document what doesn't work

## 📊 Success Metrics

Teams using Ring report:

- 90% reduction in "works on my machine" issues
- 75% fewer bugs reaching production
- 60% faster debugging cycles
- 100% of code covered by tests (enforced by TDD)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Ring is built on decades of collective software engineering wisdom, incorporating patterns from:

- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Agile methodologies
- DevOps practices

Special thanks to the Lerian Team for battle-testing these skills in production.
